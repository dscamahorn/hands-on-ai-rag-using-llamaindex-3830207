    "\n",
    "At a high level, [HyDE](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.10496.pdf) is an embedding technique that takes queries, generates a hypothetical answer, and then embeds that generated document and uses that as the final example. \n",
    "\n",
    "- 🧐 **Problem Tackled**: Addresses the struggle of creating fully zero-shot dense retrieval systems without relevance labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 📚 **Traditional Methods**: Rely on relevance labels for document retrieval based on semantic similarities.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 🚫 **Zero-Shot Challenge**: Especially tough without a large dataset for training.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is HyDE?\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a query, `HyDE` instructs a language model to generate a hypothetical document.\n",
    "\n",
    "This document captures relevance patterns but might contain inaccuracies or false details.\n",
    "\n",
    "After generating the hypothetical document, an unsupervised contrastively learned encoder encodes the document into an embedding vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "This vector identifies a neighborhood in the corpus embedding space, where similar real documents are retrieved based on vector similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Does HyDE Work?\n",
    "\n",
    "The process starts by feeding a query to a generative model with the instruction to \"write a document that answers the question\". This generates a hypothetical document that captures the essence of relevance.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Generates an embedding vector for a \"fake\" document\n",
    "\n",
    "- It does not generate any actual text content for the document\n",
    "\n",
    "- The embedding is solely for reserving space in the vectorstore index\n",
    "\n",
    "- There is no full hypothetical document text you can access later\n",
    "\n",
    "This vector is used to search against the corpus embeddings, and the most similar real documents are retrieved. The idea is that a hypothetical answer to a question is more semantically similar to the real answer than the question is. \n",
    "\n",
    "**In practice this means that your search would use GPT to generate a hypothetical answer, then embed that and use it for search**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key advantages of HyDE:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Zero-shot, no labeled data or fine-tuning needed\n",
