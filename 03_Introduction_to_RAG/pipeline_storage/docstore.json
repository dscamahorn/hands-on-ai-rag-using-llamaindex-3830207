CLAIR ADAMS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOREWORD\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a volume of inspirational poems. Its purpose is to bring men\r\ncourage and resolution, to cheer them, to fire them with new confidence\r\nwhen they grow dispirited, to strengthen their faith that THINGS CAN BE\r\nDONE. It is better for this purpose than the entire works of any one\r\npoet, for it takes the cream of many and has greater diversity than any\r\none writer can show.\r\n\r\nIt is made up chiefly of very recent poems--not such as were written for\r\nanthologies of poetical \"gems,\" but such as speak directly to the heart,\r\nalways in very simple language, often in the phrases of shop or office\r\nor street. Included, however, with the poems of the day are a few of the\r\nfine old pieces that have been of comfort to men through the ages.\r\n\r\nBesides the poems themselves, the volume contains helps to their\r\nunderstanding and enjoyment. The pieces are introduced by short\r\ncomments; these serve the same purpose as the strain played by the\r\npianist before the singer begins to sing; they create a mood, give a\r\npoint of view, throw light on the meaning of what follows. Also the\r\nlives of the authors are briefly summarized; this is in answer to our\r\nnatural interest in the writer of a poem we like, and in the case of\r\nliving poets it brings together facts hardly to be found anywhere else.\r\n\r\nFinally, the book is not one to be read and then cast aside. It is to be\r\nkept as a constant companion and an unfailing recourse in weariness or\r\ngloom. Human companions are not always in the mood to cheer us, and may\r\ntalk upon themes we dislike. But this book will converse or be silent,\r\nit is never out of sorts or discouraged, and so far from being wed to\r\nsome single topic, it will speak to us at any time on any subject we\r\ndesire.\r\n\r\nTo many authors and publishers acknowledgment is due for generous\r\npermission to use copyright material.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nAbou Ben Adhem............................. _Leigh Hunt_\r\nAnswer, The................................ _Grantland Rice_\r\nAppreciation............................... _William Judson Kibby_\r\nArrow and the Song, The.................... _Henry Wadsworth Longfellow_\r\nAwareness.................................. _Miriam Teichner_\r\n\r\nBars of Fate, The.......................... _Ellen M.H.

Yet success is not occupying a lofty place\r\nor doing conspicuous work; it is being the best that is in you. Rattling\r\naround in too big a job is much worse than filling a small one to\r\noverflowing. Dream, aspire by all means; but do not ruin the life you\r\nmust lead by dreaming pipe-dreams of the one you would like to lead.\r\nMake the most of what you have and are. Perhaps your trivial, immediate\r\ntask is your one sure way of proving your mettle. Do the thing near at\r\nhand, and great things will come to your hand to be done.\r\n\r\n\r\n  If you can't be a pine on the top of the hill\r\n    Be a scrub in the valley--but be\r\n  The best little scrub by the side of the rill;\r\n    Be a bush if you can't be a tree.\r\n\r\n  If you can't be a bush be a bit of the grass,\r\n    And some highway some happier make;\r\n  If you can't be a muskie then just be a bass--\r\n    But the liveliest bass in the lake!\r\n\r\n  We can't all be captains, we've got to be crew,\r\n    There's something for all of us here.\r\n  There's big work to do and there's lesser to do,\r\n    And the task we must do is the near.\r\n\r\n  If you can't be a highway then just be a trail,\r\n    If you can't be the sun be a star;\r\n  It isn't by size that you win or you fail--\r\n    Be the best of whatever you are!\r\n\r\n\r\n_Douglas Malloch._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HOUSE BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD\r\n\r\n\r\nThis poem has as its keynote friendship and sympathy for other people.\r\nIt is a paradox of life that by hoarding love and happiness we lose\r\nthem, and that only by giving them away can we keep them for ourselves.\r\nThe more we share, the more we possess. We of course find in other\r\npeople weaknesses and sins, but our best means of curing these are\r\nthrough a wise and sympathetic understanding.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Let me live in a house by the side of the road,\r\n    Where the race of men go by--\r\n  The men who are good and the men who are bad,\r\n    As good and as bad as I.\r\n  I would not sit in the scorner's seat,\r\n    Or hurl the cynic's ban;--\r\n  Let me live in a house by the side of the road\r\n    And be a friend to man.\r\n\r\n  I see from my house by the side of the road,\r\n    By the side of the highway of life,\r\n  The men who press with the ardor of hope,\r\n    The men who are faint with the strife.\r\n  But I turn not away from their smiles nor their tears--\r\n    Both parts of an infinite plan;--\r\n  Let me live in my house by the side of the road\r\n    And be a friend to man.\r\n\r\n  I know there are brook-gladdened meadows ahead\r\n    And mountains of wearisome height;\r\n  And the road passes on through the long afternoon\r\n    And stretches away to the night.\r\n  But still I rejoice when the travelers rejoice,\r\n    And weep with the strangers that moan,\r\n  Nor live in my house by the side of the road\r\n    Like a man who dwells alone.\r\n\r\n  Let me live in my house by the side of the road\r\n    Where the race of men go by--\r\n  They are good, they are bad, they are weak, they are strong,\r\n    Wise, foolish--so am I.\r\n  Then why should I sit in the scorner's seat\r\n    Or hurl the cynic's ban?--\r\n  Let me live in my house by the side of the road\r\n    And be a friend to man.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sam Walter Foss._\r\n\r\nFrom \"Dreams in Homespun.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOUR THINGS\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are the qualities of ideal manhood? Various people have given\r\nvarious answers to this question. Here the poet states what qualities he\r\nthinks indispensable.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Four things a man must learn to do\r\n  If he would make his record true:\r\n  To think without confusion clearly;\r\n  To love his fellow-men sincerely;\r\n  To act from honest motives purely;\r\n  To trust in God and Heaven securely.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Henry Van Dyke._\r\n\r\nFrom \"Collected Poems.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIF\r\n\r\n\r\nThe central idea of this poem is that success comes from self-control\r\nand a true sense of the values of things. In extremes lies danger. A man\r\nmust not lose heart because of doubts or opposition, yet he must do his\r\nbest to see the grounds for both. He must not be deceived into thinking\r\neither triumph or disaster final; he must use each wisely--and push on.\r\nIn all things he must hold to the golden mean. If he does, he will own\r\nthe world, and even better, for his personal reward he will attain the\r\nfull stature of manhood.\r\n\r\n\r\n  If you can keep your head when all about you\r\n    Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,\r\n  If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,\r\n    But make allowance for their doubting too;\r\n  If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,\r\n    Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,\r\n  Or being hated don't give way to hating,\r\n    And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:\r\n\r\n  If you can dream--and not make dreams your master;\r\n    If you can think--and not make thoughts your aim,\r\n  If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster\r\n    And treat those two imposters just the same;\r\n  If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken\r\n    Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,\r\n  Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,\r\n    And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:\r\n\r\n  If you can make one heap of all your winnings\r\n    And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,\r\n  And lose, and start again at your beginnings\r\n    And never breathe a word about your loss;\r\n  If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew\r\n    To serve your turn long after they are gone,\r\n  And so hold on when there is nothing in you\r\n    Except the Will which says to them; \"Hold on!\"\r\n\r\n  If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,\r\n    Or walk with Kings--nor lose the common touch,\r\n  If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,\r\n    If all men count with you, but none too much;\r\n  If you can fill the unforgiving minute\r\n    With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,\r\n  Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,\r\n    And--which is more--you'll be a Man, my son!\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rudyard Kipling._\r\n\r\nFrom \"Rudyard Kipling's Verse, 1885-1918.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINVICTUS\r\n\r\n\r\nTriumph in spirit over adverse conditions is the keynote of this poem of\r\ncourage undismayed. It rings with the power of the individual to guide\r\nhis own destiny.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Out of the night that covers me,\r\n    Black as the Pit from pole to pole,\r\n  I thank whatever gods may be\r\n    For my unconquerable soul.\r\n\r\n  In the fell clutch of circumstance\r\n    I have not winced nor cried aloud.\r\n  Under the bludgeonings of chance\r\n    My head is bloody, but unbowed.\r\n\r\n  Beyond this place of wrath and tears\r\n    Looms but the Horror of the shade,\r\n  And yet the menace of the years\r\n    Finds, and shall find, me unafraid.\r\n\r\n  It matters not how strait the gate,\r\n    How charged with punishments the scroll,\r\n  I am the master of my fate:\r\n    I am the captain of my soul.\r\n\r\n\r\n_William Ernest Henley._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIT COULDN'T BE DONE\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter a thing has been done, everybody is ready to declare it easy. But\r\nbefore it has been done, it is called impossible. One reason why people\r\nfear to embark upon great enterprises is that they see all the\r\ndifficulties at once. They know they could succeed in the initial tasks,\r\nbut they shrink from what is to follow. Yet \"a thing begun is half\r\ndone.\" Moreover the surmounting of the first barrier gives strength and\r\ningenuity for the harder ones beyond. Mountains viewed from a distance\r\nseem to be unscalable. But they can be climbed, and the way to begin is\r\nto take the first upward step. From that moment the mountains are less\r\nhigh. As Hannibal led his army across the foothills, then among the\r\nupper ranges, and finally over the loftiest peaks and passes of the\r\nAlps, or as Peary pushed farther and farther into the solitudes that\r\nencompass the North Pole, so can you achieve any purpose whatsoever if\r\nyou heed not the doubters, meet each problem as it arises, and keep ever\r\nwith you the assurance _It Can Be Done_.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Somebody said that it couldn't be done,\r\n    But he with a chuckle replied\r\n  That \"maybe it couldn't,\" but he would be one\r\n    Who wouldn't say so till he'd tried.\r\n  So he buckled right in with the trace of a grin\r\n    On his face. If he worried he hid it.\r\n  He started to sing as he tackled the thing\r\n    That couldn't be done, and he did it.\r\n\r\n  Somebody scoffed: \"Oh, you'll never do that;\r\n    At least no one ever has done it\";\r\n  But he took off his coat and he took off his hat,\r\n    And the first thing we knew he'd begun it.\r\n  With a lift of his chin and a bit of a grin,\r\n    Without any doubting or quiddit,\r\n  He started to sing as he tackled the thing\r\n    That couldn't be done, and he did it.\r\n\r\n  There are thousands to tell you it cannot be done,\r\n    There are thousands to prophesy failure;\r\n  There are thousands to point out to you one by one,\r\n    The dangers that wait to assail you.\r\n  But just buckle in with a bit of a grin,\r\n    Just take off your coat and go to it;\r\n  Just start to sing as you tackle the thing\r\n    That \"cannot be done,\" and you'll do it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Edgar A. Guest._\r\n\r\nFrom \"The Path to Home.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WELCOME MAN\r\n\r\n\r\n  There's a man in the world who is never turned down, wherever\r\n  he chances to stray; he gets the glad hand in the populous\r\n  town, or out where the farmers make hay; he's greeted with\r\n  pleasure on deserts of sand, and deep in the aisles of the\r\n  woods; wherever he goes there's the welcoming hand--he's The\r\n  Man Who Delivers the Goods. The failures of life sit around and\r\n  complain; the gods haven't treated them white; they've lost\r\n  their umbrellas whenever there's rain, and they haven't their\r\n  lanterns at night; men tire of the failures who fill with their\r\n  sighs the air of their own neighborhoods; there's one who is\r\n  greeted with love-lighted eyes--he's The Man Who Delivers the\r\n  Goods. One fellow is lazy, and watches the clock, and waits for\r\n  the whistle to blow; and one has a hammer, with which he will\r\n  knock, and one tells a story of woe; and one, if requested to\r\n  travel a mile, will measure the perches and roods; but one does\r\n  his stunt with a whistle or smile--he's The Man Who Delivers\r\n  the Goods. One man is afraid that he'll labor too hard--the\r\n  world isn't yearning for such; and one man is always alert, on\r\n  his guard, lest he put in a minute too much; and one has a\r\n  grouch or a temper that's bad, and one is a creature of moods;\r\n  so it's hey for the joyous and rollicking lad--for the One Who\r\n  Delivers the Goods!\r\n\r\n\r\n_Walt Mason._\r\n\r\nFrom \"Walt Mason, His Book.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE QUITTER\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the famous naval duel between the _Bonhomme Richard_ and the\r\n_Serapis_, John Paul Jones was hailed by his adversary to know whether\r\nhe struck his colors. \"I have not yet begun to fight,\" was his answer.\r\nWhen the surrender took place, it was not Jones's ship that became the\r\nprize of war. Everybody admires a hard fighter--the man who takes\r\nbuffets standing up, and in a spirit of \"Never say die\" is always ready\r\nfor more.\r\n\r\n\r\n  When you're lost in the wild and you're scared as a child,\r\n    And death looks you bang in the eye;\r\n  And you're sore as a boil, it's according to Hoyle\r\n    To cock your revolver and die.\r\n  But the code of a man says fight all you can,\r\n    And self-dissolution is barred;\r\n  In hunger and woe, oh it's easy to blow--\r\n    It's the hell served for breakfast that's hard.\r\n\r\n  You're sick of the game? Well now, that's a shame!\r\n    You're young and you're brave and you're bright.\r\n  You've had a raw deal, I know, but don't squeal.\r\n    Buck up, do your damnedest and fight!\r\n  It's the plugging away that will win you the day,\r\n    So don't be a piker, old pard;\r\n  Just draw on your grit; it's so easy to quit--\r\n    It's the keeping your chin up that's hard.\r\n\r\n  It's easy to cry that you're beaten and die,\r\n    It's easy to crawfish and crawl,\r\n  But to fight and to fight when hope's out of sight,\r\n    Why, that's the best game of them all.\r\n  And though you come out of each grueling bout,\r\n    All broken and beaten and scarred--\r\n  Just have one more try. It's dead easy to die,\r\n    It's the keeping on living that's hard.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Robert W.

This poem applies especially to those who\r\nare discouraged in a struggle to which they are already committed.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Everything's easy after it's done;\r\n  Every battle's a \"cinch\" that's won;\r\n  Every problem is clear that's solved--\r\n  The earth was round when it _revolved!_\r\n  But Washington stood amid grave doubt\r\n  With enemy forces camped about;\r\n  He could not know how he would fare\r\n  Till _after_ he'd crossed the Delaware.\r\n\r\n  Though the river was full of ice\r\n  He did not think about it twice,\r\n  But started across in the dead of night,\r\n  The enemy waiting to open the fight.\r\n  Likely feeling pretty blue,\r\n  Being human, same as you,\r\n  But he was brave amid despair,\r\n  And Washington crossed the Delaware!\r\n\r\n  So when you're with trouble beset,\r\n  And your spirits are soaking wet,\r\n  When all the sky with clouds is black,\r\n  Don't lie down upon your back\r\n  And look at _them_. Just do the thing;\r\n  Though you are choked, still try to sing.\r\n  If times are dark, believe them fair,\r\n  And you will cross the Delaware!\r\n\r\n\r\n_Joseph Morris._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRABBI BEN EZRA\r\n\r\n(SELECTED VERSES)\r\n\r\n\r\nTo some people success is everything, and the easier it is gained the\r\nbetter. To Browning success is nothing unless it is won by painful\r\neffort. What Browning values is struggle. Throes, rebuffs, even failure\r\nto achieve what we wish, are to be welcomed, for the effects of vigorous\r\nendeavor inweave themselves into our characters; moreover through\r\nstruggle we lift ourselves from the degradation into which the indolent\r\nfall. In the intervals of strife we may look back dispassionately upon\r\nwhat we have gone through, see where we erred and where we did wisely,\r\nwatch the workings of universal laws, and resolve to apply hereafter\r\nwhat we have hitherto learned.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Then, welcome each rebuff\r\n  That turns earth's smoothness rough,\r\n  Each sting that bids nor sit nor stand but go!\r\n  Be our joys three-parts pain!\r\n  Strive, and hold cheap the strain;\r\n  Learn, nor account the pang; dare, never grudge the throe!\r\n\r\n  For thence,--a paradox\r\n  Which comforts while it mocks,--\r\n  Shall life succeed in that it seems to fail:\r\n  What I aspired to be,\r\n  And was not, comforts me:\r\n  A brute I might have been, but would not sink i' the scale.\r\n\r\n  So, still within this life,\r\n  Though lifted o'er its strife,\r\n  Let me discern, compare, pronounce at last,\r\n  \"This rage was right i' the main,\r\n  That acquiescence vain:\r\n  The Future I may face now I have proved the Past.\"\r\n\r\n  For more is not reserved\r\n  To man, with soul just nerved\r\n  To act to-morrow what he learns to-day:\r\n  Here, work enough to watch\r\n  The Master work, and catch\r\n  Hints of the proper craft, tricks of the tool's true play.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Robert Browning._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MELANCHOLY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last invitation anybody would accept is \"Come, let us weep\r\ntogether.\" If we keep melancholy at our house, we should be careful to\r\nhave it under lock and key, so that no one will observe it.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Melancholy,\r\n  Melancholy,\r\n  I've no use for you, by Golly!\r\n  Yet I'm going to keep you hidden\r\n  In some chamber dark, forbidden,\r\n  Just as though you were a prize, sir,\r\n  Made of gold, and I a miser--\r\n  Not because I think you jolly,\r\n          Melancholy!\r\n  Not for that I mean to hoard you,\r\n  Keep you close and lodge and board you\r\n  As I would my sisters, brothers,\r\n  Cousins, aunts, and old grandmothers,\r\n  But that you shan't bother others\r\n  With your sniffling, snuffling folly,\r\n          Howling,\r\n          Yowling,\r\n  Melancholy.\r\n\r\n\r\n_John Kendrick Bangs._\r\n\r\nFrom \"Songs of Cheer.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LION PATH\r\n\r\n\r\nAdmiral Dupont was explaining to Farragut his reasons for not taking his\r\nironclads into Charleston harbor. \"You haven't given me the main reason\r\nyet,\" said Farragut. \"What's that?\" \"You didn't think you could do it.\"\r\nSo the man who thinks he can't pass a lion, can't.

See there! and there! and there again!\r\n  Great yellow, glassy eyes, close to the ground!\r\n  Look! Now the clouds are lighter I can see\r\n  The long slow lashing of the sinewy tails,\r\n  And the set quiver of strong jaws that wait--!\r\n  Go there? Not I!

But many people consider him the\r\nbest fighter for his weight who ever stepped into the prize ring. Not a\r\nfavorite at first, he won the popular heart by making good. Of course he\r\nhad great natural powers; from any position when the chance at last came\r\nhe could dart forth a sudden, wicked blow that no human being could\r\nwithstand. But more formidable still was the spirit which gave him cool\r\nand complete command of all his resources, and made him most dangerous\r\nwhen he was on the verge of being knocked out.\r\n\r\n\r\n  When the battle breaks against you and the crowd forgets to cheer\r\n  When the Anvil Chorus echoes with the essence of a jeer;\r\n  When the knockers start their panning in the knocker's nimble way\r\n  With a rap for all your errors and a josh upon your play--\r\n  There is one quick answer ready that will nail them on the wing;\r\n  There is one reply forthcoming that will wipe away the sting;\r\n  There is one elastic come-back that will hold them, as it should--\r\n  Make good.\r\n\r\n  No matter where you finish in the mix-up or the row,\r\n  There are those among the rabble who will pan you anyhow;\r\n  But the entry who is sticking and delivering the stuff\r\n  Can listen to the yapping as he giggles up his cuff;\r\n  The loafer has no come-back and the quitter no reply\r\n  When the Anvil Chorus echoes, as it will, against the sky;\r\n  But there's one quick answer ready that will wrap them in a hood--\r\n  Make good.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Grantland Rice._\r\n\r\nFrom \"The Sportlight.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WORLD IS AGAINST ME\r\n\r\n\r\nBabe Ruth doesn't complain that opposing pitchers try to strike him out;\r\nhe swings at the ball till he swats it for four bases. Ty Cobb doesn't\r\ncomplain that whole teams work wits and muscles overtime to keep him\r\nfrom stealing home; he pits himself against them all and comes galloping\r\nor hurdling or sliding in.

Guest._\r\n\r\nFrom \"Just Folks.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSAY NOT THE STRUGGLE NOUGHT AVAILETH\r\n\r\n\r\nIn any large or prolonged enterprise we are likely to take too limited a\r\nview of the progress we are making. The obstacles do not yield at some\r\ngiven point; we therefore imagine we have made no headway. The poet here\r\nuses three comparisons to show the folly of accepting this hasty and\r\npartial evidence. A soldier may think, from the little part of the\r\nbattle he can see, that the day is going against him; but by holding his\r\nground stoutly he may help his comrades in another quarter to win the\r\nvictory. Successive waves may seem to rise no higher on the land, but\r\nfar back in swollen creek and inlet is proof that the tide is coming in.\r\nAs we look toward the east, we are discouraged at the slowness of\r\ndaybreak; but by looking westward we see the whole landscape illumined.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Say not the struggle nought availeth,\r\n    The labor and the wounds are vain,\r\n  The enemy faints not, nor faileth,\r\n    And as things have been they remain.\r\n\r\n  If hopes were dupes, fears may be liars;\r\n    It may be, in yon smoke conceal'd,\r\n  Your comrades chase e'en now the fliers,\r\n    And, but for you, possess the field.\r\n\r\n  For while the tired waves, vainly breaking,\r\n    Seem here no painful inch to gain,\r\n  Far back, through creeks and inlets making,\r\n    Comes silent, flooding in, the main.\r\n\r\n  And not by eastern windows only,\r\n    When daylight comes, comes in the light,\r\n  In front, the sun climbs slow, how slowly,\r\n    But westward, look, the land is bright.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Arthur Hugh Clough._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWORTH WHILE\r\n\r\n\r\nA little boy whom his mother had rebuked for not turning a deaf ear to\r\ntemptation protested, with tears, that he had no deaf ear. But\r\ntemptation, even when heard, must somehow be resisted. Yea, especially\r\nwhen heard! We deserve no credit for resisting it unless it comes to our\r\nears like the voice of the siren.\r\n\r\n\r\n  It is easy enough to be pleasant,\r\n    When life flows by like a song,\r\n  But the man worth while is one who will smile,\r\n    When everything goes dead wrong.\r\n  For the test of the heart is trouble,\r\n    And it always comes with the years,\r\n  And the smile that is worth the praises of earth,\r\n    Is the smile that shines through tears.\r\n\r\n  It is easy enough to be prudent,\r\n    When nothing tempts you to stray,\r\n  When without or within no voice of sin\r\n    Is luring your soul away;\r\n  But it's only a negative virtue\r\n    Until it is tried by fire,\r\n  And the life that is worth the honor on earth,\r\n    Is the one that resists desire.\r\n\r\n  By the cynic, the sad, the fallen,\r\n    Who had no strength for the strife,\r\n  The world's highway is cumbered to-day,\r\n    They make up the sum of life.\r\n  But the virtue that conquers passion,\r\n    And the sorrow that hides in a smile,\r\n  It is these that are worth the homage on earth\r\n    For we find them but once in a while.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ella Wheeler Wilcox._\r\n\r\nFrom \"Poems of Sentiment.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOPE\r\n\r\n\r\nGloom and despair are really ignorance in another form. They fail to\r\nreckon with the fact that what appears to be baneful often turns out to\r\nbe good. Lincoln lost the senatorship to Douglas and thought he had\r\nended his career; had he won the contest, he might have remained only a\r\nsenator. Life often has surprise parties for us. Things come to us\r\nmasked in gloom and black; but Time, the revealer, strips off the\r\ndisguise, and lo, what we have is blessings.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Never go gloomy, man with a mind,\r\n    Hope is a better companion than fear;\r\n  Providence, ever benignant and kind,\r\n    Gives with a smile what you take with a tear;\r\n      All will be right,\r\n      Look to the light.\r\n  Morning was ever the daughter of night;\r\n  All that was black will be all that is bright,\r\n     Cheerily, cheerily, then cheer up.\r\n\r\n  Many a foe is a friend in disguise,\r\n    Many a trouble a blessing most true,\r\n  Helping the heart to be happy and wise,\r\n    With love ever precious and joys ever new.\r\n      Stand in the van,\r\n      Strike like a man!\r\n  This is the bravest and cleverest plan;\r\n  Trusting in God while you do what you can.\r\n     Cheerily, cheerily, then cheer up.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Anonymous._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI'M GLAD\r\n\r\n\r\n  I'm glad the sky is painted blue;\r\n    And the earth is painted green;\r\n  And such a lot of nice fresh air\r\n    All sandwiched in between.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Anonymous._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHAMBERED NAUTILUS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe nautilus is a small mollusk that creeps upon the bottom of the sea,\r\nthough it used to be supposed to swim, or even to spread a kind of sail\r\nso that the wind might drive it along the surface. What interests us in\r\nthis poem is the way the nautilus _grows_. Just as a tree when sawed\r\ndown has the record of its age in the number of its rings, so does the\r\nnautilus measure its age by the ever-widening compartments of its shell.\r\nThese it has successively occupied. The poet, looking upon the now empty\r\nshell, thinks of human life as growing in the same way. We advance from\r\none state of being to another, each nobler than the one which preceded\r\nit, until the spirit leaves its shell altogether and attains a glorious\r\nand perfect freedom.\r\n\r\n\r\n  This is the ship of pearl, which, poets feign,\r\n    Sailed the unshadowed main,--\r\n    The venturous bark that flings\r\n  On the sweet summer wind its purpled wings\r\n  In gulfs enchanted, where the Siren sings,\r\n    And coral reefs lie bare,\r\n  Where the cold sea-maids rise to sun their streaming hair.\r\n\r\n  Its webs of living gauze no more unfurl;\r\n    Wrecked is the ship of pearl!\r\n    And every chambered cell,\r\n  Where its dim dreaming life was wont to dwell,\r\n  As the frail tenant shaped his growing shell,\r\n    Before thee lies revealed,--\r\n  Its irised ceiling rent, its sunless crypt unsealed!\r\n\r\n  Year after year beheld the silent toil\r\n    That spread his lustrous coil;\r\n    Still, as the spiral grew,\r\n  He left the past year's dwelling for the new,\r\n  Stole with soft step its shining archway through,\r\n    Built up its idle door,\r\n  Stretched in his last-found home, and knew the old no more.\r\n\r\n  Thanks for the heavenly message brought by thee,\r\n    Child of the wandering sea,\r\n    Cast from her lap, forlorn!\r\n  From thy dead lips a clearer note is born\r\n  Than ever Triton blew from wreathed horn!\r\n    While on mine ear it rings,\r\n  Through the deep caves of thought I hear a voice that sings:--\r\n\r\n  Build thee more stately mansions, O my soul,\r\n    As the swift seasons roll!\r\n    Leave thy low-vaulted past!\r\n  Let each new temple, nobler than the last,\r\n  Shut thee from heaven with a dome more vast,\r\n    Till thou at length art free,\r\n  Leaving thine outgrown shell by life's unresting sea!\r\n\r\n\r\n_Oliver Wendell Holmes._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPIPPA'S SONG\r\n\r\n\r\nThis little song vibrates with an optimism that embraces the whole\r\nuniverse. A frequent error in quoting it is the substitution of the word\r\n_well_ for _right_. Browning is no such shallow optimist as to believe\r\nthat all is well with the world, but he does maintain that things are\r\nright with the world, for in spite of its present evils it is slowly\r\nworking its way toward perfection, and in the great scheme of things it\r\nmay make these evils themselves an instrument to move it toward its\r\nultimate goal.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The year's at the spring\r\n  And day's at the morn;\r\n  Morning's at seven;\r\n  The hillside's dew-pearled;\r\n  The lark's on the wing;\r\n  The snail's on the thorn;\r\n  God's in his heaven--\r\n  All's right with the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Robert Browning._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOWNERSHIP\r\n\r\n\r\nThe true value of anything lies, not in the object itself or in its\r\nlegal possession, but in our attitude to it. We may own a thing in fee\r\nsimple, yet derive from it nothing but vexation. For those who have\r\nlittle, as indeed for those who have much, there are no surer means of\r\nhappiness than enjoying that which they do not possess. Emerson shows us\r\nthat two harvests may be gathered from every field--a material one by\r\nthe man who raised the crop, and an esthetic or spiritual one by\r\nwhosoever can see beauty or thrill with an inner satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\r\n    They ride in Packards, those swell guys,\r\n  While I can't half afford a Ford;\r\n  Choice fillets fill a void for them,\r\n  We've cheese and prunes the place I board;\r\n  They've smirking servants hanging round,\r\n  You'd guess by whom my shoes are shined.\r\n  But all the same I'm rich as they,\r\n  For ownership's a state of mind.\r\n\r\n    _They_ own, you say? Pshaw, they possess!\r\n  And what a fellow has, has him!\r\n  The rich can't stop and just enjoy\r\n  Their lawns and shrubs and house-fronts trim.\r\n  They're tied indoors and foot the bills;\r\n  I stroll or stray, as I'm inclined--\r\n  Possession was not meant for use,\r\n  But ownership's a state of mind.\r\n\r\n    The folks who have must try to keep\r\n  Against the thieves who swarm and steal;\r\n  They dare not stride, they mince along--\r\n  Their pavement's a banana peel.\r\n  Who owns, the jeweler or I,\r\n  Yon gems by window-bars confined?\r\n  Possession lies in locks and keys;\r\n  True ownership's a state of mind.\r\n\r\n    I own my office (I've a boss,\r\n  But so have all men--so has he);\r\n  The business is not mine, but yet\r\n  I own the whole blamed company;\r\n  Stockholders are less proud than I\r\n  When competition's auld lang syned.\r\n  What care I that the profit's theirs?\r\n  I have what counts--an owner's mind.\r\n\r\n    The pretty girls I meet are mine\r\n  (I do not choose to tell them so);\r\n  I own the flowers, the trees, the birds;\r\n  I own the sunshine and the snow;\r\n  I own the block, I own the town--\r\n  The smiles, the songs of humankind.\r\n  For ownership is how you feel;\r\n  It's just a healthy state of mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n_St. Clair Adams._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA SMILING PARADOX\r\n\r\n\r\nGood nature or ill is like the loaves and fishes.

Then come the years and the struggles, and we are buffeted and\r\nbaffled, and our very ideal is eclipsed. But others have done better\r\nthan we. Weary and harassed, they yet embody our visions. And we, if we\r\nare worth our salt, do not envy them when we see them. Nor should we\r\ngrow dispirited. Rather should we rejoice in their triumph, rejoice that\r\nour dreams were not impossibilities, take courage to strive afresh for\r\nthat which we know is best.\r\n\r\n\r\n  I knew his face the moment that he passed\r\n    Triumphant in the thoughtless, cruel throng,--\r\n  Triumphant, though the quiet, tired eyes\r\n    Showed that his soul had suffered overlong.\r\n  And though across his brow faint lines of care\r\n  Were etched, somewhat of Youth still lingered there.\r\n  I gently touched his arm--he smiled at me--\r\n  He was the Man that Once I Meant to Be!\r\n\r\n  Where I had failed, he'd won from life, Success;\r\n    Where I had stumbled, with sure feet he stood;\r\n  Alike--yet unalike--we faced the world,\r\n    And through the stress he found that life was good\r\n  And I?

They look upon what is happy or\r\ninspiring with eyes that really fail to see. As Wordsworth says of Peter\r\nBell,\r\n\r\n  \"A primrose by the river's brim\r\n  A yellow primrose was to him,\r\n  And it was nothing more.\"\r\n\r\nBut to stop now and then and realize that the world is fresh and buoyant\r\nand happy, will do much to keep the spirit young.

Certain it is that nobody need hang back\r\nfrom want of something to do, to promote, to assail, to protect, to\r\nendure, or to sympathize with.\r\n\r\n\r\n  There will always be something to do, my boy;\r\n    There will always be wrongs to right;\r\n  There will always be need for a manly breed\r\n    And men unafraid to fight.\r\n  There will always be honor to guard, my boy;\r\n    There will always be hills to climb,\r\n  And tasks to do, and battles new\r\n    From now till the end of time.\r\n\r\n  There will always be dangers to face, my boy;\r\n    There will always be goals to take;\r\n  Men shall be tried, when the roads divide,\r\n    And proved by the choice they make.\r\n  There will always be burdens to bear, my boy;\r\n    There will always be need to pray;\r\n  There will always be tears through the future years,\r\n    As loved ones are borne away.\r\n\r\n  There will always be God to serve, my boy,\r\n    And always the Flag above;\r\n  They shall call to you until life is through\r\n    For courage and strength and love.\r\n  So these are things that I dream, my boy,\r\n    And have dreamed since your life began:\r\n  That whatever befalls, when the old world calls,\r\n    It shall find you a sturdy man.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Edgar A.

Barnum had shrewdness, inventiveness, hair-trigger readiness in\r\nacting or deciding, an eye for hidden possibilities, an instinct for\r\ndetermining beforehand what would prove popular. All these qualities\r\nhelped him in his original and extraordinary career. But the quality he\r\nvalued most highly was the one he called \"stick-to-it-iveness.\" This\r\ncompleted the others. Without it the great showman could not have\r\nsucceeded at all. Nor did he think that any man who lacks it will make\r\nmuch headway in life.\r\n\r\n\r\n  We know how rough the road will be,\r\n  How heavy here the load will be,\r\n    We know about the barricades that wait along the track;\r\n  But we have set our soul ahead\r\n  Upon a certain goal ahead\r\n    And nothing left from hell to sky shall ever turn us back.\r\n\r\n  We know how brief all fame must be,\r\n  We know how crude the game must be,\r\n    We know how soon the cheering turns to jeering down the block;\r\n  But there's a deeper feeling here\r\n  That Fate can't scatter reeling here,\r\n    In knowing we have battled with the final ounce in stock.\r\n\r\n  We sing of no wild glory now,\r\n  Emblazoning some story now\r\n    Of mighty charges down the field beyond some guarded pit;\r\n  But humbler tasks befalling us,\r\n  Set duties that are calling us,\r\n    Where nothing left from hell to sky shall ever make us quit.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Grantland Rice._\r\n\r\nFrom \"The Sportlight.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLONIUS'S ADVICE TO LAERTES\r\n\r\n\r\nA father's advice to his son how to conduct himself in the world: Don't\r\ntell all you think, or put into action thoughts out of harmony or\r\nproportion with the occasion. Be friendly, but not common; don't dull\r\nyour palm by effusively shaking hands with every chance newcomer. Avoid\r\nquarrels if you can, but if they are forced on you, give a good account\r\nof yourself. Hear every man's censure (opinion), but express your own\r\nideas to few. Dress well, but not ostentatiously. Neither borrow nor\r\nlend. And guarantee yourself against being false to others by setting up\r\nthe high moral principle of being true to yourself.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Give thy thoughts no tongue,\r\n  Nor any unproportion'd thought his act.\r\n  Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar;\r\n  The friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,\r\n  Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel;\r\n  But do not dull thy palm with entertainment\r\n  Of each new-hatch'd, unfledg'd comrade. Beware\r\n  Of entrance to a quarrel, but, being in,\r\n  Bear 't that th' opposed may beware of thee.\r\n  Give every man thine ear, but few thy voice;\r\n  Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.\r\n  Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,\r\n  But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;\r\n  For the apparel oft proclaims the man.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  Neither a borrower, nor a lender be;\r\n  For loan oft loses both itself and friend,\r\n  And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.\r\n  This above all: to thine own self be true,\r\n  And it must follow, as the night the day,\r\n  Thou canst not then be false to any man.\r\n\r\n\r\n_William Shakespeare._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW DO YOU TACKLE YOUR WORK?\r\n\r\n\r\nIt would be foolish to begin digging a tunnel through a mountain with a\r\nmere pick and spade. We must assemble for the task great mechanical\r\ncontrivances.

It's found in the soul of you,\r\n    And not in the realm of luck!\r\n  The world will furnish the work to do,\r\n    But you must provide the pluck.\r\n  You can do whatever you think you can,\r\n    It's all in the way you view it.\r\n  It's all in the start you make, young man:\r\n    You must feel that you're going to do it.\r\n\r\n  How do you tackle your work each day?\r\n    With confidence clear, or dread?\r\n  What to yourself do you stop and say\r\n    When a new task lies ahead?\r\n  What is the thought that is in your mind?\r\n    Is fear ever running through it?\r\n  If so, just tackle the next you find\r\n    By thinking you're going to do it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Edgar A.

This course was stupid; in time the\r\naddress which had brought him fame became a theme for disparagement and\r\nmockery. A man cannot rest upon his laurels, else he will soon lack the\r\nlaurels to rest on. If he has true ability, he must from time to time\r\nshow it, instead of asking us to recall what he did in the past. There\r\nis a natural instinct which makes the whole world kin. It is distrust of\r\na mere reputation. It is a hankering to be shown. Unless the evidence to\r\nset us right is forthcoming, we will praise dust which is gilded over\r\nrather than gold which is dusty from disuse.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Time hath, my lord, a wallet at his back,\r\n  Wherein he puts alms for oblivion,\r\n  A great-sized monster of ingratitudes:\r\n  Those scraps are good deeds past; which are devoured\r\n  As fast as they are made, forgot as soon\r\n  As done: perseverance, dear my lord,\r\n  Keeps honor bright: to have done, is to hang\r\n  Quite out of fashion, like a rusty mail\r\n  In monumental mockery. Take the instant way;\r\n  For honor travels in a strait so narrow\r\n  Where one but goes abreast: keep, then, the path;\r\n  For emulation hath a thousand sons\r\n  That one by one pursue: if you give way,\r\n  Or hedge aside from the direct forthright,\r\n  Like to an entered tide they all rush by\r\n  And leave you hindmost;\r\n  Or, like a gallant horse fallen in first rank,\r\n  Lie there for pavement to the abject rear,\r\n  O'errun and trampled on: then what they do in present,\r\n  Though less than yours in past, must o'ertop yours;\r\n  For time is like a fashionable host,\r\n  That slightly shakes his parting guest by the hand,\r\n  And with his arms outstretched, as he would fly,\r\n  Grasps in the comer: welcome ever smiles,\r\n  And farewell goes out sighing. O! let not virtue seek\r\n  Remuneration for the thing it was; for beauty, wit,\r\n  High birth, vigor of bone, desert in service,\r\n  Love, friendship, charity, are subjects all\r\n  To envious and calumniating time.\r\n  One touch of nature makes the whole world kin,\r\n  That all with one consent praise new-born gawds,\r\n  Though they are made and moulded of things past,\r\n  And give to dust that is a little gilt\r\n  More laud than gilt o'er-dusted.\r\n  The present eye praises the present object,\r\n  Since things in motion sooner catch the eye\r\n  Than what not stirs.\r\n\r\n\r\n_William Shakespeare._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFAITH\r\n\r\n\r\nFaith is not a passive thing--mere believing or waiting.

It comes once and once only to every human\r\nbeing, wise or foolish, good or wicked. If it be not perceived on the\r\ninstant, it passes by forever. No longing for it, no effort, can bring\r\nit back. Notice that this view is fatalistic; it makes opportunity an\r\nexternal thing--one that enriches men or leaves their lives empty\r\nwithout much regard to what they deserve.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Master of human destinies am I!\r\n  Fame, love, and fortune on my footsteps wait.\r\n  Cities and fields I walk; I penetrate\r\n  Deserts and seas remote, and passing by\r\n  Hovel and mart and palace--soon or late\r\n  I knock, unbidden, once at every gate!\r\n  If sleeping, wake--if feasting, rise before\r\n  I turn away. It is the hour of fate,\r\n  And they who follow me reach every state\r\n  Mortals desire, and conquer every foe\r\n  Save death; but those who doubt or hesitate,\r\n  Condemned to failure, penury, and woe,\r\n  Seek me in vain and uselessly implore.\r\n  I answer not, and I return no more!\r\n\r\n\r\n_John James Ingalls._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOPPORTUNITY\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a tide in the affairs of men,\r\nWhich, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune;\r\nOmitted, all the voyage of their life\r\nIs bound in shallows and in miseries.\r\nOn such a full sea are we now afloat;\r\nAnd we must take the current when it serves,\r\nOr lose our ventures.\r\n\r\n\r\n_William Shakespeare._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOPPORTUNITY\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the thought of the preceding poem we have here a direct answer. No\r\nmatter how a man may have failed in the past, the door of opportunity is\r\nalways open to him. He should not give way to useless regrets; he should\r\nknow that the future is within his control, that it will be what he\r\nchooses to make it.\r\n\r\n\r\n  They do me wrong who say I come no more\r\n    When once I knock and fail to find you in;\r\n  For every day I stand outside your door,\r\n    And bid you wake, and rise to fight and win.\r\n\r\n  Wail not for precious chances passed away,\r\n    Weep not for golden ages on the wane!\r\n  Each night I burn the records of the day,--\r\n    At sunrise every soul is born again!\r\n\r\n  Laugh like a boy at splendors that have sped,\r\n    To vanished joys be blind and deaf and dumb;\r\n  My judgments seal the dead past with its dead,\r\n    But never bind a moment yet to come.\r\n\r\n  Though deep in mire, wring not your hands and weep;\r\n    I lend my arm to all who say \"I can!\"\r\n  No shame-faced outcast ever sank so deep,\r\n    But yet might rise and be again a man!\r\n\r\n  Dost thou behold thy lost youth all aghast?\r\n    Dost reel from righteous Retribution's blow?\r\n  Then turn from blotted archives of the past,\r\n    And find the future's pages white as snow.\r\n\r\n  Art thou a mourner? Rouse thee from thy spell;\r\n    Art thou a sinner? Sins may be forgiven;\r\n  Each morning gives thee wings to flee from hell,\r\n    Each night a star to guide thy feet to heaven.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Walter Malone._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOPPORTUNITY\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this poem yet another view of opportunity is presented. The recreant\r\nor the dreamer complains that he has no real chance. He would succeed,\r\nhe says, if he had but the implements of success--money, influence,\r\nsocial prestige, and the like. But success lies far less in implements\r\nthan in the use we make of them. What one man throws away as useless,\r\nanother man seizes as the best means of victory at hand. For every one\r\nof us the materials for achievement are sufficient. The spirit that\r\nprompts us is what ultimately counts.\r\n\r\n\r\n  This I beheld, or dreamed it in a dream:--\r\n  There spread a cloud of dust along a plain;\r\n  And underneath the cloud, or in it, raged\r\n  A furious battle, and men yelled, and swords\r\n  Shocked upon swords and shields. A prince's banner\r\n  Wavered, then staggered backward, hemmed by foes.\r\n  A craven hung along the battle's edge,\r\n  And thought, \"Had I a sword of keener steel--\r\n  That blue blade that the king's son bears,--but this\r\n  Blunt thing--!\" he snapt and flung it from his hand,\r\n  And lowering crept away and left the field.\r\n  Then came the king's son, wounded, sore bestead,\r\n  And weaponless, and saw the broken sword,\r\n  Hilt-buried in the dry and trodden sand,\r\n  And ran and snatched it, and with battle-shout\r\n  Lifted afresh he hewed his enemy down,\r\n  And saved a great cause that heroic day.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Edward Rowland Sill._\r\n\r\nFrom \"Poems.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMY PHILOSOPHY\r\n\r\n\r\nThough dogs persist in barking at the moon, the moon's business is not\r\nto answer the dogs or to waste strength placating them, but simply to\r\nshine.

But\r\nit could not serve its full purpose without the presence, here and\r\nthere, of older poems--of \"classics.\" These express a truth, a mood, or\r\na spirit that is universal, and they express it in words of noble\r\ndignity and beauty. They are not always easy to understand; they are\r\ncrops we must patiently cultivate, not crops that volunteer. But they\r\nwear well; they grow upon us; we come back to them again and again, and\r\nstill they are fresh, living, significant--not empty, meaningless, and\r\nweather-worn, like a last year's crow's nest.\r\n\r\nSuch a poem is _Ulysses_. It is shot through and through with the spirit\r\nof strenuous and never-ceasing endeavor--a spirit manifest in a hero who\r\nhas every temptation to rest and enjoy. Ulysses is old. After ten long\r\nyears of warfare before Troy, after endless misfortunes on his homeward\r\nvoyage, after travels and experiences that have taken him everywhere and\r\nshown him everything that men know and do, he has returned to his rude\r\nnative kingdom. He is reunited with his wife Penelope and his son\r\nTelemachus. He is rich and famous. Yet he is unsatisfied. The task and\r\nroutine of governing a slow, materially minded people, though suited to\r\nhis son's temperament, are unsuited to his. He wants to wear out rather\r\nthan to rust out. He wants to discover what the world still holds. He\r\nwants to drink life to the lees. The morning has passed, the long day\r\nhas waned, twilight and the darkness are at hand. But scant as are the\r\nyears left to him, he will use them in a last, incomparable quest. He\r\nrallies his old comrades--tried men who always\r\n\r\n \"With a frolic welcome took\r\n The thunder and the sunshine\"--\r\n\r\nand asks them to brave with him once more the hazards and the hardships\r\nof the life of vast; unsubdued enterprise.\r\n\r\n\r\n  It little profits that an idle king,\r\n  By this still hearth, among these barren crags,\r\n  Match'd with an aged wife, I mete and dole\r\n  Unequal laws unto a savage race,\r\n  That hoard, and sleep, and feed, and know not me.\r\n  I cannot rest from travel; I will drink\r\n  Life to the lees. All times I have enjoy'd\r\n  Greatly, have suffer'd greatly, both with those\r\n  That loved me, and alone; on shore, and when\r\n  Thro' scudding drifts the rainy Hyades\r\n  Vext the dim sea. I am become a name;\r\n  For always roaming with a hungry heart\r\n  Much have I seen and known,--cities of men\r\n  And manners, climates, councils, governments,\r\n  Myself not least, but honor'd of them all,--\r\n  And drunk delight of battle with my peers,\r\n  Far on the ringing plains of windy Troy.\r\n  I am a part of all that I have met;\r\n  Yet all experience is an arch wherethro'\r\n  Gleams that untravell'd world whose margin fades\r\n  For ever and for ever when I move.\r\n  How dull it is to pause, to make an end,\r\n  To rust unburnish'd, not to shine in use!\r\n  As tho' to breathe were life! Life piled on life\r\n  Were all too little, and of one to me\r\n  Little remains; but every hour is saved\r\n  From that eternal silence, something more,\r\n  A bringer of new things; and vile it were\r\n  For some three suns to store and hoard myself,\r\n  And this gray spirit yearning in desire\r\n  To follow knowledge like a sinking star,\r\n  Beyond the utmost bound of human thought.\r\n    This is my son, mine own Telemachus,\r\n  To whom I leave the sceptre and the isle,--\r\n  Well-beloved of me, discerning to fulfil\r\n  This labor, by slow prudence to make mild\r\n  A rugged people, and thro' soft degrees\r\n  Subdue them to the useful and the good.\r\n  Most blameless is he, centred in the sphere\r\n  Of common duties, decent not to fail\r\n  In offices of tenderness, and pay\r\n  Meet adoration to my household gods,\r\n  When I am gone. He works his work, I mine.\r\n    There lies the port; the vessel puffs her sail;\r\n  There gloom the dark, broad seas. My mariners,\r\n  Souls that have toil'd, and wrought, and thought with me,--\r\n  That ever with a frolic welcome took\r\n  The thunder and the sunshine, and opposed\r\n  Free hearts, free foreheads,--you and I are old;\r\n  Old age hath yet his honor and his toil.\r\n  Death closes all; but something ere the end,\r\n  Some work of noble note, may yet be done,\r\n  Not unbecoming men that strove with Gods.\r\n  The lights begin to twinkle from the rocks;\r\n  The long day wanes; the slow moon climbs; the deep\r\n  Moans round with many voices.

He played the game,\r\n    Took his chances, bet his hand,\r\n  When at last the showdown came\r\n    An' he lost, he kept his sand;\r\n  Didn't weep an' didn't pray,\r\n    Didn't waver er repent,\r\n  Simply tossed his cards away,\r\n    Knowin' well just what it meant.\r\n  Never claimed the deck was stacked,\r\n    Never called the game a snide,\r\n  Acted like a man should act,\r\n    Took his medicine--an' died!\r\n\r\n  So I say it here again,\r\n  What I think is true of men;\r\n  They should try to do what's right,\r\n  Fair an' square an' clean an' white,\r\n  But, whatever is their line,\r\n  Bad er good er foul er fine,\r\n  Let 'em go the Limit, play\r\n  Like a plunger, that's the way!\r\n\r\n\r\n_Berton Braley._\r\n\r\nFrom \"Songs of the Workaday World.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHARLOTTE PERKINS GILMAN]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRESOLVE\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are some things we should all resolve to do.

Only\r\nstruggle and suffering can give a man the qualities that enable him to\r\nrender large service to humanity. Lincoln was born in a log cabin. He\r\nsplit rails, and conned a few books by the firelight in the evening. He\r\nbecame a backwoods lawyer with apparently no advantages or encouraging\r\nprospects. But all the while he had his visions, which ever became\r\nnobler; and the adversities he knew but gave him the deeper sympathy for\r\nothers and the wider and steadier outlook on human problems. Thus when\r\nthe supreme need arose, Lincoln was ready--harsh-visaged nature had done\r\nits work of moulding and preparing a man.\r\n\r\n\r\n  When Nature wants to drill a man\r\n  And thrill a man,\r\n  And skill a man,\r\n  When Nature wants to mould a man\r\n  To play the noblest part;\r\n  When she yearns with all her heart\r\n  To create so great and bold a man\r\n  That all the world shall praise--\r\n  Watch her method, watch her ways!\r\n  How she ruthlessly perfects\r\n  Whom she royally elects;\r\n  How she hammers him and hurts him\r\n  And with mighty blows converts him\r\n  Into trial shapes of clay which only Nature understands--\r\n  While his tortured heart is crying and he lifts beseeching hands!--\r\n  How she bends, but never breaks,\r\n  When his good she undertakes....\r\n  How she uses whom she chooses\r\n  And with every purpose fuses him,\r\n  By every art induces him\r\n  To try his splendor out--\r\n  Nature knows what she's about.\r\n\r\n  When Nature wants to take a man\r\n  And shake a man\r\n  And wake a man;\r\n  When Nature wants to make a man\r\n  To do the Future's will;\r\n  When she tries with all her skill\r\n  And she yearns with all her soul\r\n  To create him large and whole....\r\n  With what cunning she prepares him!\r\n  How she goads and never spares him,\r\n  How she whets him and she frets him\r\n  And in poverty begets him....\r\n  How she often disappoints\r\n  Whom she sacredly anoints,\r\n  With what wisdom she will hide him,\r\n  Never minding what betide him\r\n  Though his genius sob with slighting and his pride may not forget!\r\n  Bids him struggle harder yet.\r\n  Makes him lonely\r\n  So that only\r\n  God's high messages shall reach him\r\n  So that she may surely teach him\r\n  What the Hierarchy planned.\r\n  Though he may not understand\r\n  Gives him passions to command--\r\n  How remorselessly she spurs him,\r\n  With terrific ardor stirs him\r\n  When she poignantly prefers him!\r\n\r\n  When Nature wants to name a man\r\n  And fame a man\r\n  And tame a man;\r\n  When Nature wants to shame a man\r\n  To do his heavenly best....\r\n  When she tries the highest test\r\n  That her reckoning may bring--\r\n  When she wants a god or king!--\r\n  How she reins him and restrains him\r\n  So his body scarce contains him\r\n  While she fires him\r\n  And inspires him!\r\n  Keeps him yearning, ever burning for a tantalising goal--\r\n  Lures and lacerates his soul.\r\n  Sets a challenge for his spirit,\r\n  Draws it higher when he's near it--\r\n  Makes a jungle, that he clear it;\r\n  Makes a desert, that he fear it\r\n  And subdue it if he can--\r\n  So doth Nature make a man.\r\n  Then, to test his spirit's wrath\r\n  Hurls a mountain in his path--\r\n  Puts a bitter choice before him\r\n  And relentless stands o'er him.\r\n  \"Climb, or perish!\" so she says....\r\n  Watch her purpose, watch her ways!\r\n\r\n  Nature's plan is wondrous kind\r\n  Could we understand her mind ...\r\n  Fools are they who call her blind.\r\n  When his feet are torn and bleeding\r\n  Yet his spirit mounts unheeding,\r\n  All his higher powers speeding\r\n  Blazing newer paths and fine;\r\n  When the force that is divine\r\n  Leaps to challenge every failure and his ardor still is sweet\r\n  And love and hope are burning in the presence of defeat....\r\n  Lo, the crisis! Lo, the shout\r\n  That must call the leader out.\r\n  When the people need salvation\r\n    Doth he come to lead the nation....\r\n  Then doth Nature show her plan\r\n  When the world has found--a man!\r\n\r\n\r\n_Angela Morgan._\r\n\r\nFrom \"Forward, March!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER AND THE BEES\r\n\r\n(FROM \"HENRY V.\")\r\n\r\n\r\nWe often wish that we might do some other man's work, occupy his social\r\nor political station. But such an interchange is not easy. The world is\r\ncomplex, and its adjustments have come from long years of experience.\r\nEach man does well to perform the tasks for which nature and training\r\nhave fitted him. And instead of feeling envy toward other people, we\r\nshould rejoice that all labor, however diverse, is to one great end--it\r\nmakes life richer and fuller.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Therefore doth heaven divide\r\n  The state of man in divers functions,\r\n  Setting endeavor in continual motion;\r\n  To which is fix\u00e9d, as an aim or butt,\r\n  Obedience: for so work the honey-bees,\r\n  Creatures that by a rule in nature teach\r\n  The act of order to a peopled kingdom.\r\n  They have a king and officers of sorts;\r\n  Where some, like magistrates, correct at home,\r\n  Others, like merchants, venture trade abroad,\r\n  Others, like soldiers, arm\u00e9d in their stings,\r\n  Make boot upon the summer's velvet buds;\r\n  Which pillage they with merry march bring home\r\n  To the tent-royal of their emperor:\r\n  Who, busied in his majesty, surveys\r\n  The singing masons building roofs of gold,\r\n  The civil citizens kneading up the honey,\r\n  The poor mechanic porters crowding in\r\n  Their heavy burdens at his narrow gate,\r\n  The sad-eyed justice, with his surly hum,\r\n  Delivering o'er to executors pale\r\n  The lazy yawning drone. I this infer,\r\n  That many things, having full reference\r\n  To one consent, may work contrariously.\r\n\r\n\r\n_William Shakespeare._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSELF-DEPENDENCE\r\n\r\n\r\nOne star does not ask another to adore it or amuse it; Mt. Shasta,\r\nthough it towers for thousands of feet above its neighbors, does not\r\nrepine that it is alone or that the adjacent peaks see much that it\r\nmisses under the clouds. Nature does not trouble itself about what the\r\nrest of nature is doing. But man constantly worries about other\r\nmen--what they think of him, do to him, fail to emulate in him, have or\r\nsecure in comparison with him. He lacks nature's inward quietude.\r\nCalmness and peace come by being self-contained.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Weary of myself, and sick of asking\r\n  What I am, and what I ought to be,\r\n  At this vessel's prow I stand, which bears me\r\n  Forwards, forwards, o'er the starlit sea.\r\n\r\n  And a look of passionate desire\r\n  O'er the sea and to the stars I send:\r\n  \"Ye who from my childhood up have calmed me,\r\n  Calm me, ah, compose me to the end!\r\n\r\n  \"Ah, once more,\" I cried, \"ye stars, ye waters,\r\n  On my heart your mighty charm renew;\r\n  Still, still let me, as I gaze upon you,\r\n  Feel my soul becoming vast like you!\"\r\n\r\n  From the intense, clear, star-sown vault of heaven,\r\n  Over the lit sea's unquiet way,\r\n  In the rustling night-air came the answer:\r\n  \"Wouldst thou BE as these are? LIVE as they.\r\n\r\n  \"Unaffrighted by the silence round them,\r\n  Undistracted by the sights they see,\r\n  These demand not that the things without them\r\n  Yield them love, amusement, sympathy.\r\n\r\n  \"And with joy the stars perform their shining,\r\n  And the sea its long, moon-silver'd roll;\r\n  For self-poised they live, nor pine with noting\r\n  All the fever of some differing soul.\r\n\r\n  \"Bounded by themselves, and unregardful\r\n  In what state God's other works may be,\r\n  In their own tasks all their powers pouring,\r\n  These attain the mighty life you see.\"\r\n\r\n  O air-born voice! long since, severely clear,\r\n  A cry like thine in mine own heart I hear:\r\n  \"Resolve to be thyself; and know that he\r\n  Who finds himself, loses his misery!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Matthew Arnold._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA LITTLE PRAYER\r\n\r\n\r\nWe should strive to bring what happiness we can to others. More still,\r\nwe should strive to bring them no unhappiness. When we come to die, it\r\nis, as George Eliot once said, not our kindness or our patience or our\r\ngenerosity that we shall regret, but our intolerance and our harshness.\r\n\r\n\r\n  That I may not in blindness grope,\r\n    But that I may with vision clear\r\n  Know when to speak a word of hope\r\n    Or add a little wholesome cheer.\r\n\r\n  That tempered winds may softly blow\r\n    Where little children, thinly clad,\r\n  Sit dreaming, when the flame is low,\r\n    Of comforts they have never had.\r\n\r\n  That through the year which lies ahead\r\n    No heart shall ache, no cheek be wet,\r\n  For any word that I have said\r\n    Or profit I have tried to get.\r\n\r\n\r\n_S.E. Kiser._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA MAN'S A MAN FOR A' THAT\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is said that once at a laird's house Burns was placed at a second\r\ntable, and that this rankled in his breast and caused him to write his\r\npoem on equality. He insists that rank, wealth, and external\r\ndistinctions are merely the stamp on the guinea; the man is the gold\r\nitself. Snobbishness he abhors; poverty he confesses to without hanging\r\nhis head in the least; the pith of sense and the pride of worth he\r\ndeclares superior to any dignity thrust upon a person from the outside.\r\nIn a final, prophetic mood he looks forward to the time when a democracy\r\nof square dealing shall prevail, praise shall be reserved for merit, and\r\nmen the world over shall be to each other as brothers.

But\r\nwould he live for them? That, often, is the more heroic course--and the\r\nmore sensible. A rich man was hiring a driver for his carriage. He asked\r\neach applicant how close he could drive to a precipice without toppling\r\nover. \"One foot,\" \"Six inches,\" \"Three inches,\" ran the replies. But an\r\nIrishman declared, \"Faith, and I'd keep as far away from the place as I\r\ncould.\" \"Consider yourself employed,\" was the rich man's comment.\r\n\r\n\r\n  So he died for his faith. That is fine--\r\n    More than most of us do.\r\n  But stay, can you add to that line\r\n    That he lived for it, too?\r\n\r\n  In death he bore witness at last\r\n    As a martyr to truth.\r\n  Did his life do the same in the past\r\n    From the days of his youth?\r\n\r\n  It is easy to die. Men have died\r\n    For a wish or a whim--\r\n  From bravado or passion or pride.\r\n    Was it harder for him?\r\n\r\n  But to live: every day to live out\r\n    All the truth that he dreamt,\r\n  While his friends met his conduct with doubt,\r\n    And the world with contempt--\r\n\r\n  Was it thus that he plodded ahead,\r\n    Never turning aside?\r\n  Then we'll talk of the life that he led--\r\n    Never mind how he died.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ernest H.

So serious was the situation that all\r\nthe subordinate officers advised retreat. But Lee, though too maimed to\r\nattack, would not leave the field save of his own volition. \"If\r\nMcClellan wants a battle,\" he declared, \"he can have it.\" McClellan\r\nhesitated, and through the whole of the next day kept his great army\r\nidle. The effect upon the morale of the two forces, and the two\r\ngovernments, can be imagined.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The man who is there with the wallop and punch\r\n    The one who is trained to the minute,\r\n  May well be around when the trouble begins,\r\n    But you seldom will find he is in it;\r\n  For they let him alone when they know he is there\r\n    For any set part in the ramble,\r\n  To pick out the one who is shrinking and soft\r\n    And not quite attuned to the scramble.\r\n\r\n  The one who is fixed for whatever they start\r\n    Is rarely expected to prove it;\r\n  They pass him along for the next shot in sight\r\n    Where they take a full wind-up and groove it;\r\n  For who wants to pick on a bulldog or such\r\n    Where a quivering poodle is handy,\r\n  When he knows he can win with a kick or a brick\r\n    With no further trouble to bandy?\r\n\r\n\r\n_Grantland Rice._\r\n\r\nFrom \"The Sportlight.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTWO AT A FIRESIDE\r\n\r\n\r\n  I built a chimney for a comrade old,\r\n    I did the service not for hope or hire--\r\n  And then I traveled on in winter's cold,\r\n    Yet all the day I glowed before the fire.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Edwin Markham._\r\n\r\nFrom \"The Man with the Hoe, and Other Poems.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO-DAY\r\n\r\n\r\nWe often lose the happiness of to-day by brooding over the sorrows of\r\nyesterday or fearing the troubles of to-morrow. This is exceedingly\r\nfoolish. There is always _some_ pleasure at hand; seize it, and at no\r\ntime will you be without pleasure. You cannot change the past, but your\r\nspirit at this moment will in some measure shape your future. Live life,\r\ntherefore, in the present tense; do not miss the joys of to-day.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Sure, this world is full of trouble--\r\n    I ain't said it ain't.\r\n  Lord!

I've had mine--\r\n    But to-day is fine.\r\n\r\n  It's to-day that I am livin',\r\n    Not a month ago,\r\n  Havin', losin', takin', givin',\r\n    As time wills it so.\r\n  Yesterday a cloud of sorrow\r\n    Fell across the way;\r\n  It may rain again to-morrow,\r\n    It may rain--but, say,\r\n    Ain't it fine to-day!\r\n\r\n\r\n_Douglas Malloch._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ARROW AND THE SONG\r\n\r\n\r\nWe can calculate with fair accuracy the number of miles an automobile\r\nwill go in an hour. We can gauge pretty closely the amount of\r\nmerchandise a given sum of money will buy. But a good deed or a kind\r\nimpulse is not measurable. Their influence works in devious ways and\r\nlives on when perhaps we can see them no more.\r\n\r\n\r\n  I shout an arrow into the air,\r\n  It fell to earth, I knew not where;\r\n  For, so swiftly it flew, the sight\r\n  Could not follow it in its flight.\r\n\r\n  I breathed a song into the air,\r\n  It fell to earth, I knew not where;\r\n  For who has sight so keen and strong,\r\n  That it can follow the flight of song?\r\n\r\n  Long, long afterward, in an oak\r\n  I found the arrow, still unbroke;\r\n  And the song, from beginning to end,\r\n  I found again in the heart of a friend.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Henry Wadsworth Longfellow._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE INNER LIGHT\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"Thrice is he armed that hath his quarrel just,\r\n  And he but naked, though locked up in steel,\r\n  Whose conscience with injustice is corrupted,\"\r\n\r\nsays Shakespeare. But not only does a clear conscience give power; it\r\nalso gives light. With it we could sit at the center of the earth and\r\nyet enjoy the sunshine. Without it we live in a rayless prison.\r\n\r\n\r\n  He that has light within his own clear breast\r\n  May sit i' the center, and enjoy bright day:\r\n  But he that hides a dark soul and foul thoughts\r\n  Benighted walks under the midday sun;\r\n  Himself is his own dungeon.\r\n\r\n\r\n_John Milton._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE THINGS THAT HAVEN'T BEEN DONE BEFORE\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is said that if you hold a stick in front of the foremost sheep in a\r\nflock that files down a trail in the mountains, he will jump it--and\r\nthat every sheep thereafter will jump when he reaches the spot, even if\r\nthe stick be removed. So are many people mere unthinking imitators,\r\nblind to facts and opportunities about them. Kentucky could not be lived\r\nin by the white race till Daniel Boone built his cabin there. The air\r\nwas not part of the domain of humanity till the Wright brothers made\r\nthemselves birdmen.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The things that haven't been done before,\r\n    Those are the things to try;\r\n  Columbus dreamed of an unknown shore\r\n    At the rim of the far-flung sky,\r\n  And his heart was bold and his faith was strong\r\n    As he ventured in dangers new,\r\n  And he paid no heed to the jeering throng\r\n    Or the fears of the doubting crew.\r\n\r\n  The many will follow the beaten track\r\n    With guideposts on the way,\r\n  They live and have lived for ages back\r\n    With a chart for every day.\r\n  Someone has told them it's safe to go\r\n    On the road he has traveled o'er,\r\n  And all that they ever strive to know\r\n    Are the things that were known before.\r\n\r\n  A few strike out, without map or chart,\r\n    Where never a man has been,\r\n  From the beaten paths they draw apart\r\n    To see what no man has seen.\r\n  There are deeds they hunger alone to do;\r\n    Though battered and bruised and sore,\r\n  They blaze the path for the many, who\r\n    Do nothing not done before.\r\n\r\n  The things that haven't been done before\r\n    Are the tasks worth while to-day;\r\n  Are you one of the flock that follows, or\r\n    Are you one that shall lead the way?\r\n  Are you one of the timid souls that quail\r\n    At the jeers of a doubting crew,\r\n  Or dare you, whether you win or fail,\r\n    Strike out for a goal that's new?\r\n\r\n\r\n_Edgar A.

I've\r\n  just been reading of a gent who joined the has-been ranks, at\r\n  fifty years without a cent, or credit at the banks. But\r\n  undismayed he buckled down, refusing to be beat, and captured\r\n  fortune and renown; he's now on Easy Street. Men say that\r\n  fellows down and out ne'er leave the rocky track, but facts\r\n  will show, beyond a doubt, that has-beens do come back. I know,\r\n  for I who write this rhyme, when forty-odd years old, was down\r\n  and out, without a dime, my whiskers full of mold. By black\r\n  disaster I was trounced until it jarred my spine; I was a\r\n  failure so pronounced I didn't need a sign. And after I had\r\n  soaked my coat, I said (at forty-three), \"I'll see if I can\r\n  catch the goat that has escaped from me.\" I labored hard; I\r\n  strained my dome, to do my daily grind, until in triumph I came\r\n  home, my billy-goat behind. And any man who still has health\r\n  may with the winners stack, and have a chance at fame and\r\n  wealth--for has-beens do come back.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Walt Mason._\r\n\r\nFrom \"Walt Mason, His Book.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWISHING\r\n\r\n\r\nHorace Greeley said that no one need fear the editor who indulged in\r\ndiatribes against the prevalence of polygamy in Utah, but that\r\nmalefactors had better look out when an editor took up his pen against\r\nabuses in his own city.

Let's get closer to somebody's side,\r\n  See what his dreams are and learn how he tried,\r\n  See if our scoldings won't give way to praise\r\n  One of these days.\r\n\r\n  Say! Let's not wither! Let's branch out and rise\r\n  Out of the byways and nearer the skies.\r\n  Let's spread some shade that's refreshing and deep\r\n  Where some tired traveler may lie down and sleep.\r\n  Say!

They\r\nwent to work and in a day or two were ready for their report. But\r\nAgassiz didn't come round. To kill time they went to work again,\r\nobserved, dissected, conjectured, and when at the end of a fortnight\r\nAgassiz finally appeared, they felt that their knowledge was really\r\nexhaustive. The master's brief comment was that they had made a fair\r\nbeginning, and again he left. They then fell to in earnest and after\r\nweeks and months of investigation declared that a fish was the most\r\nfascinating of studies. If our interest in life fails, it is not from\r\nmaterial to work on. No two leaves are alike, not two human beings are\r\nalike, and if we are discerning, the attraction of any one of them is\r\ninfinite.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Grumpy Guy was feeling blue; the Grumpy Guy was glum;\r\n  The Grumpy Guy with baleful eye took Misery for a chum.\r\n  He hailed misfortunes as his pals, and murmured, \"Let 'em come!\"\r\n\r\n  \"Oh, what's the blooming use?\" he yelped, his face an angry red,\r\n  \"When everything's been thought before and everything's been said?\r\n  And what's a Grumpy Guy to do except to go to bed?\r\n\r\n  \"And where's the joy the poets sing, the merriment and fun?\r\n  How can one start a thing that's new when everything's begun?--\r\n  When everything's been planned before and everything's been done?--\r\n\r\n  \"When everything's been dreamed before and everything's been sought?\r\n  When everything that ever ran has, so to speak, been caught?--\r\n  When every game's been played before and every battle fought?\"\r\n\r\n  I started him at solitaire, a fooling, piffling game.\r\n  He played it ninety-seven hours and failed to find it tame.\r\n  In all the times he dealt the cards no two games were the same.\r\n\r\n  He never tumbled to its tricks nor mastered all its curves.\r\n  He grunted, \"Well, this takes the cake, the pickles and preserves!\r\n  Its infinite variety is getting on my nerves.\"\r\n\r\n  \"Its infinite variety!\" I scoffed. \"Just fifty-two\r\n  Poor trifling bits of pasteboard!--their combinations few\r\n  Compared to what there is in man!--the poorest!--even you!\r\n\r\n  \"Variety!

To the terrors of an\r\nunknown sea and the mutinous dismay of the sailors Columbus has but two\r\nthings to oppose--his faith and his unflinching will. But these suffice,\r\nas they always do. In the last four lines of the poem is a lesson for\r\nour nation to-day. The seas upon which our ideals have launched us are\r\nperilous and uncharted.

In the course of a battle an\r\nofficer reported to Stonewall Jackson that he must fall back because his\r\nammunition had been spoiled by a rainstorm. \"So has the enemy's,\" was\r\nthe instant reply. \"Give them the bayonet.\" This resolute spirit won the\r\nbattle.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Hang the gray days!\r\n  The deuce-to-pay days!\r\n  The feeling-blue and nothing-to-do days!\r\n  The sit-by-yourself-for-there's-nothing-new days!\r\n  When the cat that Care killed without excuse\r\n  With your inner self's crying, \"Oh, what's the use?\"\r\n  And you wonder whatever is going to become of you,\r\n  And you feel that a cipher expresses the sum of you;\r\n  And you know that you'll never,\r\n  Oh, never, be clever,\r\n  Spite of all your endeavor\r\n  Or hard work or whatever!\r\n  Oh, gee!\r\n  What a mix-up you see\r\n  When you look at the world where you happen to be!\r\n  Where strangers are hateful and friends are a bore,\r\n  And you know in your heart you will smile nevermore!\r\n  Gee, kid!\r\n  Clap on the lid!\r\n  It is all a mistake!

In this passage a disappointed and\r\nharassed king comments on the slumber which he cannot woo to his couch,\r\nyet which his humblest subject enjoys.\r\n\r\n\r\n  How many thousand of my poorest subjects\r\n  Are at this hour asleep! O sleep! O gentle sleep!\r\n  Nature's soft nurse, how have I frighted thee,\r\n  That thou no more wilt weigh my eyelids down\r\n  And steep my senses in forgetfulness?\r\n  Why rather, sleep, liest thou in smoky cribs,\r\n  Upon uneasy pallets stretching thee,\r\n  And hushed with buzzing night-flies to thy slumber,\r\n  Than in the perfumed chambers of the great,\r\n  Under the canopies of costly state,\r\n  And lulled with sound of sweetest melody?\r\n  O thou dull god! why liest thou with the vile\r\n  In loathsome beds, and leav'st the kingly couch\r\n  A watch-case or a common 'larum bell?\r\n  Wilt thou upon the high and giddy mast\r\n  Seal up the ship-boy's eyes, and rock his brains\r\n  In cradle of the rude imperious surge,\r\n  And in the visitation of the winds,\r\n  Who take the ruffian billows by the top,\r\n  Curling their monstrous heads, and hanging them\r\n  With deafning clamor in the slippery clouds,\r\n  That with the hurly death itself awakes?\r\n  Canst thou, O partial sleep! give thy repose\r\n  To the wet sea-boy in an hour so rude,\r\n  And in the calmest and most stillest night,\r\n  With all appliances and means to boot,\r\n  Deny it to a king? Then, happy low, lie down!\r\n  Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown.\r\n\r\n\r\n_William Shakespeare._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEVER TROUBLE TROUBLE\r\n\r\n\r\nTo borrow trouble is to contract a debt that any man is better without.\r\nIf your troubles are not borrowed, they are not likely to be many or\r\ngreat.\r\n\r\n\r\n    I used to hear a saying\r\n  That had a deal of pith;\r\n  It gave a cheerful spirit\r\n  To face existence with,\r\n  Especially when matters\r\n  Seemed doomed to go askew,\r\n  'Twas _Never trouble trouble\r\n  Till trouble troubles you._\r\n\r\n    Not woes at hand, those coming\r\n  Are hardest to resist;\r\n  We hear them stalk like giants,\r\n  We see them through a mist.\r\n  But big things in the brewing\r\n  Are small things in the brew;\r\n  So never trouble trouble\r\n  Till trouble troubles you.\r\n\r\n    Just look at things through glasses\r\n  That show the evidence;\r\n  One lens of them is courage,\r\n  The other common sense.\r\n  They'll make it clear, misgivings\r\n  Are just a bugaboo;\r\n  No more you'll trouble trouble\r\n  Till trouble troubles you.\r\n\r\n\r\n_St. Clair Adams._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCLEAR THE WAY\r\n\r\n\r\nHumanity is always meeting obstacles. All honor to the men who do not\r\nfear obstacles, but push them aside and press on. Stephenson was\r\nexplaining his idea that a locomotive steam engine could run along a\r\ntrack and draw cars after it. \"But suppose a cow gets on the track,\"\r\nsome one objected. \"So much the worse,\" said Stephenson, \"for the cow.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n  Men of thought! be up and stirring,\r\n    Night and day;\r\n  Sow the seed, withdraw the curtain,\r\n    Clear the way!\r\n  Men of action, aid and cheer them,\r\n    As ye may!\r\n  There's a fount about to stream,\r\n  There's a light about to gleam,\r\n  There's a warmth about to glow,\r\n  There's a flower about to blow;\r\n  There's midnight blackness changing\r\n    Into gray!\r\n  Men of thought and men of action,\r\n    Clear the way!\r\n\r\n  Once the welcome light has broken,\r\n    Who shall say\r\n  What the unimagined glories\r\n    Of the day?\r\n  What the evil that shall perish\r\n    In its ray?\r\n  Aid it, hopes of honest men;\r\n  Aid the dawning, tongue and pen;\r\n  Aid it, paper, aid it, type,\r\n  Aid it, for the hour is ripe;\r\n  And our earnest must not slacken\r\n    Into play.\r\n  Men of thought and men of action,\r\n    Clear the way!\r\n\r\n  Lo! a cloud's about to vanish\r\n      From the day;\r\n  And a brazen wrong to crumble\r\n      Into clay!\r\n  With the Right shall many more\r\n  Enter, smiling at the door;\r\n  With the giant Wrong shall fall\r\n  Many others great and small,\r\n  That for ages long have held us\r\n      For their prey.\r\n  Men of thought and men of action,\r\n      Clear the way!\r\n\r\n\r\n_Charles Mackay._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nONE FIGHT MORE\r\n\r\n\r\nWe need not expect much of the man who, when defeated, gives way either\r\nto despair or to a wild impulse for immediate revenge. But from the man\r\nwho stores up his strength quietly and bides his time for a new effort,\r\nwe may expect everything.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Now, think you, Life, I am defeated quite?\r\n    More than a single battle shall be mine\r\n  Before I yield the sword and give the sign\r\n    And turn, a crownless outcast, to the night.\r\n  Wounded, and yet unconquered in the fight,\r\n    I wait in silence till the day may shine\r\n  Once more upon my strength, and all the line\r\n    Of your defenses break before my might.\r\n\r\n  Mine be that warrior's blood who, stricken sore,\r\n    Lies in his quiet chamber till he hears\r\n  Afar the clash and clang of arms, and knows\r\n    The cause he lived for calls for him once more;\r\n  And straightway rises, whole and void of fears,\r\n    And armed, turns him singing to his foes.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Theodosia Garrison._\r\n\r\nFrom \"The Earth Cry.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA PSALM OF LIFE\r\n\r\nAt times this existence of ours seems to be meaningless; whether we have\r\nsucceeded or whether we have failed appears to make little difference to\r\nus, and therefore effort seems scarcely worth while. But Longfellow\r\ntells us this view is all wrong. The past can take care of itself, and\r\nwe need not even worry very much about the future; but if we are true to\r\nour own natures, we must be up and doing in the present. Time is short,\r\nand mastery in any field of human activity is so long a process that it\r\nforbids us to waste our moments. Yet we must learn also how to wait and\r\nendure. In short, we must not become slaves to either indifference or\r\nimpatience, but must make it our business to play a man's part in life.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Tell me not, in mournful numbers,\r\n    Life is but an empty dream!--\r\n  For the soul is dead that slumbers,\r\n    And things are not what they seem.\r\n\r\n  Life is real! Life is earnest!\r\n    And the grave is not its goal;\r\n  Dust thou art, to dust returnest,\r\n    Was not spoken of the soul.\r\n\r\n  Not enjoyment, and not sorrow,\r\n    Is our destined end or way;\r\n  But to act, that each to-morrow\r\n    Find us farther than to-day.\r\n\r\n  Art is long, and Time is fleeting,\r\n    And our hearts, though stout and brave,\r\n  Still, like muffled drums, are beating\r\n    Funeral marches to the grave.\r\n\r\n  In the world's broad field of battle,\r\n    In the bivouac of Life,\r\n  Be not like dumb, driven cattle!\r\n    Be a hero in the strife!\r\n\r\n  Trust no Future, howe'er pleasant!\r\n    Let the dead Past bury its dead!\r\n  Act,--act in the living Present!\r\n    Heart within, and God o'erhead!\r\n\r\n  Lives of great men all remind us\r\n    We can make our lives sublime,\r\n  And, departing, leave behind us\r\n    Footprints on the sands of time;\r\n\r\n  Footprints, that perhaps another,\r\n    Sailing o'er life's solemn main,\r\n  A forlorn and shipwrecked brother,\r\n    Seeing, shall take heart again.\r\n\r\n  Let us, then, be up and doing,\r\n    With a heart for any fate;\r\n  Still achieving, still pursuing,\r\n    Learn to labor and to wait.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Henry Wadsworth Longfellow._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA CREED\r\n\r\nMen may seem sundered from each other; but the soul that each possesses,\r\nand the destiny common to all, invest them with a basic brotherhood.\r\n\r\n\r\n  There is a destiny that makes us brothers:\r\n    None goes his way alone:\r\n  All that we send into the lives of others\r\n    Comes back into our own.\r\n\r\n  I care not what his temples or his creeds,\r\n    One thing holds firm and fast--\r\n  That into his fateful heap of days and deeds\r\n    The soul of a man is cast.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Edwin Markham_\r\n\r\nFrom \"Lincoln, and Other Poems.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE CRY\r\n\r\nWe should win if we can. But in any case we should prove our manhood by\r\nfighting.\r\n\r\n\r\n  More than half beaten, but fearless,\r\n  Facing the storm and the night;\r\n  Breathless and reeling but tearless,\r\n  Here in the lull of the fight,\r\n  I who bow not but before thee,\r\n  God of the fighting Clan,\r\n  Lifting my fists, I implore Thee,\r\n  Give me the heart of a Man!\r\n\r\n  What though I live with the winners\r\n  Or perish with those who fall?\r\n  Only the cowards are sinners,\r\n  Fighting the fight is all.\r\n  Strong is my foe--he advances!\r\n  Snapt is my blade, O Lord!\r\n  See the proud banners and lances!\r\n  Oh, spare me this stub of a sword!\r\n\r\n  Give me no pity, nor spare me;\r\n  Calm not the wrath of my Foe.\r\n  See where he beckons to dare me!\r\n  Bleeding, half beaten--I go.\r\n  Not for the glory of winning,\r\n  Not for the fear of the night;\r\n  Shunning the battle is sinning--\r\n  Oh, spare me the heart to fight!\r\n\r\n  Red is the mist about me;\r\n  Deep is the wound in my side;\r\n  \"Coward\" thou criest to flout me?\r\n  O terrible Foe, thou hast lied!\r\n  Here with my battle before me,\r\n  God of the fighting Clan,\r\n  Grant that the woman who bore me\r\n  Suffered to suckle a Man!\r\n\r\n\r\n_John G.

The\r\nmeans of happiness are surprisingly simple. We need not be rich or\r\nhigh-placed or powerful in order to be content. In fact the lowly are\r\noften the best satisfied. Izaak Walton lived the simple life and thanked\r\nGod that there were so many things in the world of which he had no need.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Art thou poor, yet hast thou golden slumbers?\r\n    O sweet content!\r\n  Art thou rich, yet is thy mind perplexed?\r\n    O punishment!\r\n  Dost thou laugh to see how fools are vexed\r\n  To add to golden numbers, golden numbers?\r\n  O sweet content! O sweet, O sweet content!\r\n    Work apace, apace, apace, apace;\r\n    Honest labor bears a lovely face;\r\n  Then hey nonny nonny, hey nonny nonny!\r\n\r\n  Canst drink the waters of the crisp\u00e9d spring?\r\n    O sweet content!\r\n  Swimm'st thou in wealth, yet sink'st in thine own tears?\r\n    O punishment!\r\n  Then he that patiently want's burden bears\r\n  No burden bears, but is a king, a king!\r\n  O sweet content! O sweet, O sweet content!\r\n    Work apace, apace, apace, apace;\r\n    Honest labor bears a lovely face;\r\n  Then hey nonny nonny, hey nonny nonny!\r\n\r\n\r\n_Thomas Dekker._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIF YOU CAN'T GO OVER OR UNDER, GO ROUND\r\n\r\n\r\nOften the straight road to the thing we desire is blocked. We should not\r\nthen weakly give over our purpose, but should set about attaining it by\r\nsome indirect method. A politician knows that one way of getting a man's\r\nvote is to please the man's wife, and that one way of pleasing the wife\r\nis to kiss her baby.\r\n\r\n\r\n  A baby mole got to feeling big,\r\n  And wanted to show how he could dig;\r\n  So he plowed along in the soft, warm dirt\r\n  Till he hit something hard, and it surely hurt!\r\n  A dozen stars flew out of his snout;\r\n  He sat on his haunches, began to pout;\r\n  Then rammed the thing again with his head--\r\n  His grandpap picked him up half dead.\r\n  \"Young man,\" he said, \"though your pate is bone.\r\n  You can't butt your way through solid stone.\r\n  This bit of advice is good, I've found:\r\n  If you can't go over or under, go round.\"\r\n\r\n  A traveler came to a stream one day,\r\n  And because it presumed to cross his way,\r\n  And wouldn't turn round to suit his whim\r\n  And change its course to go with him,\r\n  His anger rose far more than it should,\r\n  And he vowed he'd cross right where he stood.\r\n  A man said there was a bridge below,\r\n  But not a step would he budge or go.\r\n  The current was swift and the bank was steep,\r\n  But he jumped right in with a violent leap.\r\n  A fisherman dragged him out half-drowned:\r\n  \"When you can't go over or under, go round.\"\r\n\r\n  If you come to a place that you can't get _through,_\r\n  Or _over_ or _under_, the thing to do\r\n  Is to find a way _round_ the impassable wall,\r\n  Not say you'll go YOUR way or not at all.\r\n  You can always get to the place you're going,\r\n  If you'll set your sails as the wind is blowing.\r\n  If the mountains are high, go round the valley;\r\n  If the streets are blocked, go up some alley;\r\n  If the parlor-car's filled, don't scorn a freight;\r\n  If the front door's closed, go in the side gate.\r\n  To reach your goal this advice is sound:\r\n  If you can't go over or under, go round!\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Joseph Morris._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHICK IS THE DARKNESS\r\n\r\n\r\nHow many of us forget when the sun goes down that it will rise again!\r\n\r\n\r\n  Thick is the darkness--\r\n    Sunward, O, sunward!\r\n  Rough is the highway--\r\n    Onward, still onward!\r\n\r\n  Dawn harbors surely\r\n    East of the shadows.\r\n  Facing us somewhere\r\n    Spread the sweet meadows.\r\n\r\n  Upward and forward!\r\n    Time will restore us:\r\n  Light is above us,\r\n    Rest is before us.\r\n\r\n\r\n_William Ernest Henley._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BELLY AND THE MEMBERS\r\n\r\n(ADAPTED FROM \"CORIOLANUS\")\r\n\r\n\r\nNo doubt the world is cursed with grafters and parasites--men who live\r\noff the body economic and give nothing substantial in return. But an\r\nappearance of uselessness is not always proof of such. We should not\r\ncondemn men in ignorance. As old as Aesop is the fable of the rebellion\r\nof the other members of the body against the idle unproductiveness of\r\nthe belly. In this passage the fable is used as an answer to the\r\nplebeians of Rome who have complained that the patricians are merely an\r\nencumbrance.\r\n\r\n\r\n  There was a time when all the body's members\r\n  Rebelled against the belly; thus accused it:\r\n  That only like a gulf it did remain\r\n  I' the midst o' the body, idle and unactive,\r\n  Still cupboarding the viand, never bearing\r\n  Like labor with the rest, where the other instruments\r\n  Did see and hear, devise, instruct, walk, feel,\r\n  And, mutually participant, did minister\r\n  Unto the appetite and affection common\r\n  Of the whole body. Note me this, good friend;\r\n  Your most grave belly was deliberate,\r\n  Not rash like his accusers, and thus answered:\r\n  \"True is it, my incorporate friends,\" quoth he,\r\n  \"That I receive the general food at first,\r\n  Which you do live upon; and fit it is;\r\n  Because I am the store-house and the shop\r\n  Of the whole body: but, if you do remember,\r\n  I send it through the rivers of your blood,\r\n  Even to the court, the heart, to the seat o' the brain:\r\n  And, through the cranks and offices of man,\r\n  The strongest nerves and small inferior veins\r\n  From me receive that natural competency\r\n  Whereby they live. Though all at once cannot\r\n  See what I do deliver out to each,\r\n  Yet I can make my audit up, that all\r\n  From me do back receive the flour of all,\r\n  And leave me but the bran.\" What say you to 't?\r\n\r\n\r\n_William Shakespeare._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CELESTIAL SURGEON\r\n\r\n\r\nWe may acquire the resolution to be happy by resting on a bed of roses.\r\nIf that fails us, we should try a bed of nettles.\r\n\r\n\r\n  If I have faltered more or less\r\n  In my great task of happiness;\r\n  If I have moved among my race\r\n  And shown no glorious morning face;\r\n  If beams from happy human eyes\r\n  Have moved me not; if morning skies,\r\n  Books, and my food, and summer rain\r\n  Knocked on my sullen heart in vain:--\r\n  Lord, thy most pointed pleasure take\r\n  And stab my spirit broad awake;\r\n  Or, Lord, if too obdurate I,\r\n  Choose thou, before that spirit die,\r\n  A piercing pain, a killing sin,\r\n  And to my dead heart run them in!\r\n\r\n\r\n_Robert Louis Stevenson._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAN, BIRD, AND GOD\r\n\r\n\r\nRobert Bruce, despairing of his country's cause, was aroused to new hope\r\nand purpose by the sight of a spider casting its lines until at last it\r\nhad one that held. In the following passage the poet, uncertain as to\r\nhis own future, yet trusts the providence which guides the birds in\r\ntheir long and uncharted migrations.\r\n\r\n\r\n  I go to prove my soul!\r\n  I see my way as birds their trackless way.\r\n  I shall arrive! what time, what circuit first,\r\n  I ask not: but unless God send his hail\r\n  Or blinding fireballs, sleet or stifling snow,\r\n  In some time, his good time, I shall arrive:\r\n  He guides me and the bird. In his good time!\r\n\r\n\r\n_Robert Browning._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHIS ALLY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe thought of this poem is that a man's best helper may be that which\r\ngives him no direct aid at all--a sense of humor.\r\n\r\n\r\n  He fought for his soul, and the stubborn fighting\r\n    Tried hard his strength.\r\n  \"One needs seven souls for this long requiting,\"\r\n    He said at length.\r\n\r\n  \"Six times have I come where my first hope jeered me\r\n    And laughed me to scorn;\r\n  But now I fear as I never feared me\r\n    To fall forsworn.\r\n\r\n  \"God! when they fight upright and at me\r\n    I give them back\r\n  Even such blows as theirs that combat me;\r\n    But now, alack!\r\n\r\n  \"They fight with the wiles of fiends escaping\r\n    And underhand.\r\n  Six times, O God, and my wounds are gaping!\r\n    I--reel to stand.\r\n\r\n  \"Six battles' span!

There are times\r\nwhen the right thing is to strive, to fight. To put forth one's best\r\neffort is itself a reward. But sometimes it brings a material reward\r\nalso. The frog that after falling into the churn found that it couldn't\r\njump out and wouldn't try, was drowned. The frog that kept leaping in\r\nbrave but seemingly hopeless endeavor at last churned the milk, mounted\r\nthe butter for a final effort, and escaped.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Submission? They have preached at that so long.\r\n  As though the head bowed down would right the wrong,\r\n    As though the folded hand, the coward heart\r\n  Were saintly signs of souls sublimely strong;\r\n    As though the man who acts the waiting part\r\n    And but submits, had little wings a-start.\r\n  But may I never reach that anguished plight\r\n  Where I at last grow weary of the fight.\r\n\r\n  Submission: \"Wrong of course must ever be\r\n  Because it ever was. 'Tis not for me\r\n    To seek a change; to strike the maiden blow.\r\n  'Tis best to bow the head and not to see;\r\n    'Tis best to dream, that we need never know\r\n    The truth. To turn our eyes away from woe.\"\r\n  Perhaps. But ah--I pray for keener sight,\r\n  And may I not grow weary of the fight.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Miriam Teichner._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA PRAYER\r\n\r\n\r\nGaribaldi, the Italian patriot, said to his men: \"I do not promise you\r\nease; I do not promise you comfort. I promise you hardship, weariness,\r\nsuffering; but I promise you victory.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n  I do not pray for peace,\r\n    Nor ask that on my path\r\n  The sounds of war shall shrill no more,\r\n    The way be clear of wrath.\r\n  But this I beg thee, Lord,\r\n    Steel Thou my heart with might,\r\n  And in the strife that men call life,\r\n    Grant me the strength to fight.\r\n\r\n  I do not pray for arms,\r\n    Nor shield to cover me.\r\n  What though I stand with empty hand,\r\n    So it be valiantly!\r\n  Spare me the coward's fear--\r\n    Questioning wrong or right:\r\n  Lord, among these mine enemies,\r\n    Grant me the strength to fight.\r\n\r\n  I do not pray that Thou\r\n    Keep me from any wound,\r\n  Though I fall low from thrust and blow,\r\n    Forced fighting to the ground;\r\n  But give me wit to hide\r\n    My hurt from all men's sight,\r\n  And for my need the while I bleed,\r\n    Lord, grant me strength to fight.\r\n\r\n  I do not pray that Thou\r\n    Shouldst grant me victory;\r\n  Enough to know that from my foe\r\n    I have no will to flee.\r\n  Beaten and bruised and banned,\r\n    Flung like a broken sword,\r\n  Grant me this thing for conquering--\r\n    Let me die fighting, Lord!\r\n\r\n\r\n_Theodosia Garrison._\r\n\r\nFrom \"The Earth Cry.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTABILITY\r\n\r\n\r\nWhom do we wish for our friends and allies? On whom would we wish to\r\ndepend in a time of need? Those who are not the slaves of fortune, but\r\nhave made the most of both her buffets and her rewards. Those who\r\ncontrol their fears and rash impulses, and do not give way to sudden\r\nemotion. Amid confusion and disaster men like these will stand, as\r\nJackson did at Bull Run, like a veritable stone wall.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice\r\n  And could of men distinguish, her election\r\n  Hath sealed thee for herself; for thou hast been\r\n  As one, in suffering all, that suffers nothing,\r\n  A man that fortune's buffets and rewards\r\n  Hast ta'en with equal thanks; and bless'd are those\r\n  Whose blood and judgment are so well commingled\r\n  That they are not a pipe for fortune's finger\r\n  To sound what stop she please.

His incredulity did not of course do away with\r\nthe existence of the creature. But our incredulity about many of our\r\ndifficulties will do away with them. They exist chiefly in our\r\nimaginations.\r\n\r\n\r\n  I stood before the bars of Fate\r\n  And bowed my head disconsolate;\r\n  So high they seemed, so fierce their frown.\r\n  I thought no hand could break them down.\r\n\r\n  Beyond them I could hear the songs\r\n  Of valiant men who marched in throngs;\r\n  And joyful women, fair and free,\r\n  Looked back and waved their hands to me.\r\n\r\n  I did not cry \"Too late! too late!\"\r\n  Or strive to rise, or rail at Fate,\r\n  Or pray to God. My coward heart,\r\n  Contented, played its foolish part.\r\n\r\n  So still I sat, the tireless bee\r\n  Sped o'er my head, with scorn for me,\r\n  And birds who build their nests in air\r\n  Beheld me, as I were not there.\r\n\r\n  From twig to twig, before my face,\r\n  The spiders wove their curious lace,\r\n  As they a curtain fine would see\r\n  Between the hindering bars and me.\r\n\r\n  Then, sudden change! I heard the call\r\n  Of wind and wave and waterfall;\r\n  From heaven above and earth below\r\n  A clear command--\"ARISE AND GO!\"\r\n\r\n  I upward sprang in all my strength,\r\n  And stretched my eager hands at length\r\n  To break the bars--no bars were there;\r\n  My fingers fell through empty air!\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ellen M.H.

An old\r\nnegro was complaining that the railroad would not pay him for his mule,\r\nwhich it had killed--nay, would not even give him back his rope. \"What\r\nrope?\" he was asked. \"Why, sah,\" answered he, \"de rope dat I tied de\r\nmule on de track wif.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n  Nothing to do but work,\r\n    Nothing to eat but food,\r\n  Nothing to wear but clothes\r\n    To keep one from going nude.\r\n\r\n  Nothing to breathe but air\r\n    Quick as a flash 'tis gone;\r\n  Nowhere to fall but off,\r\n    Nowhere to stand but on.\r\n\r\n  Nothing to comb but hair,\r\n    Nowhere to sleep but in bed,\r\n  Nothing to weep but tears,\r\n    Nothing to bury but dead.\r\n\r\n  Nothing to sing but songs,\r\n    Ah, well, alas! alack!\r\n  Nowhere to go but out,\r\n    Nowhere to come but back.\r\n\r\n  Nothing to see but sights,\r\n    Nothing to quench but thirst,\r\n  Nothing to have but what we've got;\r\n    Thus thro' life we are cursed.\r\n\r\n  Nothing to strike but a gait;\r\n    Everything moves that goes.\r\n  Nothing at all but common sense\r\n    Can ever withstand these woes.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ben King_.\r\n\r\nFrom \"Ben King's Verse.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are irritating, troublesome people about us. Of what use is it to\r\nbe irritating in our turn or to add to the trouble? Most offenders have\r\ntheir better side. Our wisest course is to find this and upon the basis\r\nof it build up a better relationship.\r\n\r\n\r\n    There's a fellow in your office\r\n  Who complains and carps and whines\r\n  Till you'd almost do a favor\r\n  To his heirs and his assigns.\r\n  But I'll tip you to a secret\r\n  (And this chap's of course involved)--\r\n  He's no foeman to be fought with;\r\n  He's a problem to be solved.\r\n\r\n    There's a duffer in your district\r\n  Whose sheer cussedness is such\r\n  He has neither pride nor manners--\r\n  No, nor gumption, overmuch.\r\n  'Twould be great to up and tell him\r\n  Where to go. But be resolved--\r\n  He's no foeman to be fought with,\r\n  Just a problem to be solved.\r\n\r\n    This old earth's (I'm sometimes thinking)\r\n  One menagerie of freaks--\r\n  Folks invested with abnormal\r\n  Lungs or brains or galls or beaks.\r\n  But we're not just shrieking monkeys\r\n  In a dim, vast cage revolved;\r\n  We're not foemen to be fought with,\r\n  Merely problems to be solved.\r\n\r\n\r\n_St. Clair Adams_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROSPICE\r\n\r\n\r\nHere the poet looks forward to death. He does not ask for an easy death;\r\nhe does not wish to creep past an experience which all men sooner or\r\nlater must face, and which many men have faced so heroically. He has\r\nfought well in life; he wishes to make the last fight too. The poem was\r\nwritten shortly after the death of Mrs. Browning, and the closing lines\r\nrefer to her.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Fear death?--to feel the fog in my throat,\r\n    The mist in my face,\r\n  When the snows begin, and the blasts denote\r\n    I am nearing the place,\r\n  The power of the night, the press of the storm,\r\n    The post of the foe;\r\n  Where he stands, the Arch Fear in a visible form,\r\n    Yet the strong man must go:\r\n  For the journey is done and the summit attained,\r\n    And the barriers fall,\r\n  Though a battle's to fight ere the guerdon be gained,\r\n    The reward of it all.\r\n  I was ever a fighter, so--one fight more,\r\n    The best and the last!\r\n  I would hate that death bandaged my eyes, and forbore.\r\n    And bade me creep past.\r\n  No! let me taste the whole of it, fare like my peers\r\n    The heroes of old,\r\n  Bear the brunt, in a minute pay glad life's arrears\r\n    Of pain, darkness and cold.\r\n  For sudden the worst turns the best to the brave,\r\n    The black minute's at end,\r\n  And the elements' rage, the fiend-voices that rave,\r\n    Shall dwindle, shall blend,\r\n  Shall change, shall become first a peace out of pain,\r\n    Then a light, then thy breast,\r\n  O thou soul of my soul! I shall clasp thee again,\r\n    And with God be the rest!\r\n\r\n\r\n_Robert Browning_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GREATNESS OF THE SOUL\r\n\r\n\r\nGeologists tell us that in the long processes of the ages mountains have\r\nbeen raised and leveled, continents formed and washed away. Astronomers\r\ntell us that in space are countless worlds, many of them doubtless\r\ninhabited--perhaps by creatures of a lower type than we, perhaps by\r\ncreatures of a higher. The magnitude of these changes and of these\r\nworlds makes the imagination reel. But on one thing we can rely--the\r\ngreatness of the human soul. On one thing we can confidently build--the\r\nmen whose spirit is lofty, divine.\r\n\r\n\r\n  For tho' the Giant Ages heave the hill\r\n  And break the shore, and evermore\r\n  Make and break, and work their will;\r\n  Tho' world on world in myriad myriads roll\r\n  Round us, each with different powers,\r\n  And other forms of life than ours,\r\n  What know we greater than the soul?\r\n  On God and Godlike men we build our trust.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Alfred Tennyson_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEINELET\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat sheer perseverance can accomplish, even in matters of the heart, is\r\nrevealed in this little poem written in Heine's mood of mingled\r\nseriousness and gayety.\r\n\r\n\r\n  He asked if she ever could love him.\r\n    She answered him, no, on the spot.\r\n  He asked if she ever could love him.\r\n    She assured him again she could not.\r\n\r\n  He asked if she ever could love him.\r\n    She laughed till his blushes he hid.\r\n  He asked if she ever could love him.\r\n    By God, she admitted she did.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Gamaliel Bradford_.\r\n\r\nFrom \"Shadow Verses.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTAND FORTH!\r\n\r\n\r\nThe human spirit can triumph over difficulties, as flowers bloom along\r\nthe edge of the Alpine snow.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Stand forth, my soul, and grip thy woe,\r\n  Buckle the sword and face thy foe.\r\n  What right hast thou to be afraid\r\n  When all the universe will aid?\r\n  Ten thousand rally to thy name,\r\n  Horses and chariots of flame.\r\n  Do others fear? Do others fail?\r\n  _My soul must grapple and prevail_.\r\n  My soul must scale the mountainside\r\n  And with the conquering army ride--\r\n  Stand forth, my soul!\r\n\r\n  Stand forth, my soul, and take command.\r\n  'Tis I, thy master, bid thee stand.\r\n  Claim thou thy ground and thrust thy foe,\r\n  Plead not thine enemy should go.\r\n  Let others cringe! My soul is free,\r\n  No hostile host can conquer me.\r\n  There lives no circumstance so great\r\n  Can make me yield, or doubt my fate.\r\n  My soul must know what kings have known.\r\n  Must reach and claim its rightful throne--\r\n  Stand forth, my soul!\r\n\r\n  I ask no truce, I have no qualms,\r\n  I seek no quarter and no alms.\r\n  Let those who will obey the sod,\r\n  My soul sprang from the living God.\r\n  'Tis I, the king, who bid thee stand;\r\n  Grasp with thy hand my royal hand--\r\n  Stand forth!\r\n\r\n\r\n_Angela Morgan_.\r\n\r\nFrom \"The Hour Has Struck.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WALT MASON]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIONS AND ANTS\r\n\r\n\r\n  Once a hunter met a lion near the hungry critter's lair, and the\r\n  way that lion mauled him was decidedly unfair; but the hunter\r\n  never whimpered when the surgeons, with their thread, sewed up\r\n  forty-seven gashes in his mutilated head; and he showed the\r\n  scars in triumph, and they gave him pleasant fame, and he\r\n  always blessed the lion that had camped upon his frame. Once\r\n  that hunter, absent minded, sat upon a hill of ants, and about\r\n  a million bit him, and you should have seen him dance! And he\r\n  used up lots of language of a deep magenta tint, and\r\n  apostrophized the insects in a style unfit to print. And it's\r\n  thus with worldly troubles; when the big ones come along, we\r\n  serenely go to meet them, feeling valiant, bold and strong, but\r\n  the weary little worries with their poisoned stings and smarts,\r\n  put the lid upon our courage, make us gray, and break our\r\n  hearts.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Walt Mason_.\r\n\r\nFrom \"Walt Mason, His Book.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFE, NOT DEATH\r\n\r\n\r\nSometimes life is so unsatisfying that we think we should like to be rid\r\nof it. But we really are not longing for death; we are longing for more\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Whatever crazy sorrow saith,\r\n  No life that breathes with human breath\r\n  Has ever truly longed for death.\r\n\r\n    'Tis life, whereof our nerves are scant,\r\n  Oh life, not death, for which we pant;\r\n  More life, and fuller, that I want.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Alfred Tennyson_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE UNMUSICAL SOLOIST\r\n\r\n\r\nIn any sort of athletic contest a man who individually is good--perhaps\r\neven of the very best--may be a poor member of the team because he\r\nwishes to do all the playing himself and will not co-operate with his\r\nfellows. Every coach knows how such a man hashes the game. The same\r\nthing is true in business or in anything else where many people work\r\ntogether; a really capable man often fails because he hogs the center of\r\nthe stage and wants to be the whole show. To seek petty, immediate\r\ntriumphs instead of earning and waiting for the big, silent approval of\r\none's own conscience and of those who understand, is a mark of\r\ninferiority. It is also a barrier to usefulness, for an egotistical man\r\nis necessarily selfish and a selfish man cannot co-operate.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Music hath charms--at least it should;\r\n  Even a homely voice sounds good\r\n  That sings a cheerful, gladsome song\r\n  That shortens the way, however long.\r\n  A screechy fife, a bass drum's beat\r\n  Is wonderful music to marching feet;\r\n  A scratchy fiddle or banjo's thump\r\n  May tickle the toes till they want to jump.\r\n  But one musician fills the air\r\n  With discords that jar folks everywhere.\r\n  A pity it is he ever was born--\r\n  The discordant fellow who toots his own horn.\r\n\r\n  He gets in the front where all can see--\r\n  \"Now turn the spot-light right on me,\"\r\n  He says, and sings in tones sonorous\r\n  His own sweet halleluiah chorus.\r\n  Refrain and verse are both the same--\r\n  The pronoun I or his own name.\r\n  He trumpets his worth with such windy tooting\r\n  That louder it sounds than cowboys shooting.\r\n  This man's a nuisance wherever he goes,\r\n  For the world soon tires of the chap who blows.\r\n  Whether mighty in station or hoer of corn,\r\n  Unwelcome's the fellow who toots his own horn.\r\n\r\n  The poorest woodchopper makes the most sound;\r\n  A poor cook clatters the most pans around;\r\n  The rattling spoke carries least of the load;\r\n  And jingling pennies pay little that's owed;\r\n  A rooster crows but lays no eggs;\r\n  A braggart blows but drives no pegs.\r\n  He works out of harmony with any team,\r\n  For others are skim milk and he is the cream.\r\n  \"The world,\" so far as he can see,\r\n  \"Consists of a few other folks and ME.\"\r\n  He richly deserves to be held in scorn--\r\n  The ridiculous fellow who toots his own horn.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Joseph Morris_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON DOWN THE ROAD\r\n\r\n\r\nHazlitt said that the defeat of the Whigs could be read in the shifting\r\nand irresolute countenance of Charles James Fox, and the triumph of the\r\nTories in Pitt's \"aspiring nose.\" The empires of the Montezumas are\r\nconquered by men who, like Cortez, risk everything in the enterprise and\r\nmake retreat impossible by burning their ships behind them.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Hold to the course, though the storms are about you;\r\n    Stick to the road where the banner still flies;\r\n  Fate and his legions are ready to rout you--\r\n    Give 'em both barrels--and aim for their eyes.\r\n\r\n  Life's not a rose bed, a dream or a bubble,\r\n    A living in clover beneath cloudless skies;\r\n  And Fate hates a fighter who's looking for trouble,\r\n    So give 'im both barrels--and shoot for the eyes.\r\n\r\n  Fame never comes to the loafers and sitters,\r\n    Life's full of knots in a shifting disguise;\r\n  Fate only picks on the cowards and quitters,\r\n    So give 'em both barrels--and aim for the eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Grantland Rice_.\r\n\r\nFrom \"The Sportlight.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEETIN' TROUBLE\r\n\r\n\r\nSome students of biology planned a trick on their professor.

Just so for us the memory of happy sights we have\r\nseen comes back again to bring us pleasure.\r\n\r\n\r\n  I wander'd lonely as a cloud\r\n  That floats on high o'er vales and hills,\r\n  When all at once I saw a crowd,\r\n  A host of golden daffodils,\r\n  Beside the lake, beneath the trees,\r\n  Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.\r\n\r\n  Continuous as the stars that shine\r\n  And twinkle on the milky way,\r\n  They stretch'd in never-ending line\r\n  Along the margin of a bay:\r\n  Ten thousand saw I at a glance\r\n  Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.\r\n\r\n  The waves beside them danced, but they\r\n  Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:--\r\n  A Poet could not but be gay\r\n  In such a jocund company!\r\n  I gazed--and gazed--but little thought\r\n  What wealth the show to me had brought;\r\n\r\n  For oft, when on my couch I lie\r\n  In vacant or in pensive mood,\r\n  They flash upon that inward eye\r\n  Which is the bliss of solitude;\r\n  And then my heart with pleasure fills,\r\n  And dances with the daffodils.\r\n\r\n\r\n_William Wordsworth._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FRANK L. STANTON]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA LITTLE THANKFUL SONG\r\n\r\n\r\nNo man is without a reason to be thankful. If he lacks gratitude, the\r\nfault lies at least partly with himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n  For what are we thankful for? For this:\r\n    For the breath and the sunlight of life\r\n  For the love of the child, and the kiss\r\n    On the lips of the mother and wife.\r\n      For roses entwining,\r\n        For bud and for bloom,\r\n      And hopes that are shining\r\n        Like stars in the gloom.\r\n\r\n  For what are we thankful for? For this:\r\n    The strength and the patience of toil;\r\n  For ever the dreams that are bliss--\r\n    The hope of the seed in the soil.\r\n      For souls that are whiter\r\n        From day unto day;\r\n      And lives that are brighter\r\n        From going God's way.\r\n\r\n  For what are we thankful for? For all:\r\n    The sunlight--the shadow--the song;\r\n  The blossoms may wither and fall,\r\n    But the world moves in music along!\r\n        For simple, sweet living,\r\n          (Tis love that doth teach it)\r\n        A heaven forgiving\r\n          And faith that can reach it!\r\n\r\n\r\n_Frank L. Stanton._\r\n\r\nFrom \"The Atlanta Constitution.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTWO RAINDROPS\r\n\r\n(A FABLE)\r\n\r\n\r\nAn egotist is not only selfish; he is usually ridiculous as well, for he\r\nsets us to wondering as to any possible ground for his exalted opinion\r\nof himself. The real workers do not emphasize their superiority to other\r\npeople, do not even emphasize the differences, but are grateful that\r\nthey may share in humanity's privilege of rendering service.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Two little raindrops were born in a shower,\r\n  And one was so pompously proud of his power,\r\n  He got in his head an extravagant notion\r\n  He'd hustle right off and swallow the ocean.\r\n  A blade of grass that grew by the brook\r\n  Called for a drink, but no notice he took\r\n  Of such trifling things. He must hurry to be\r\n  Not a mere raindrop, but the whole sea.\r\n  A stranded ship needed water to float,\r\n  But he could not bother to help a boat.\r\n  He leaped in the sea with a puff and a blare--\r\n  And nobody even knew he was there!\r\n\r\n  But the other drop as along it went\r\n  Found the work to do for which it was sent:\r\n  It refreshed the lily that drooped its head,\r\n  And bathed the grass that was almost dead.\r\n  It got under the ships and helped them along,\r\n  And all the while sang a cheerful song.\r\n  It worked every step of the way it went,\r\n  Bringing joy to others, to itself content.\r\n  At last it came to its journey's end,\r\n  And welcomed the sea as an old-time friend.\r\n  \"An ocean,\" it said, \"there could not be\r\n  Except for the millions of drops like me.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Joseph Morris,_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMY WAGE\r\n\r\n\r\nWe may as well aim high as low, ask much as little. The world will not\r\nmiss what it gives us, and our reward will largely be governed by our\r\ndemands.\r\n\r\n\r\n  I bargained with Life for a penny,\r\n  And Life would pay no more,\r\n  However I begged at evening\r\n  When I counted my scanty store;\r\n\r\n  For Life is a just employer,\r\n  He gives you what you ask,\r\n  But once you have set the wages,\r\n  Why, you must bear the task.\r\n\r\n  I worked for a menial's hire,\r\n  Only to learn, dismayed,\r\n  That any wage I had asked of Life,\r\n  Life would have paid.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Jessie B. Rittenhouse._\r\n\r\nFrom \"The Door of Dreams.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GIFT\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Trust thyself,\" says Emerson; \"every heart vibrates to that iron\r\nstring.\" This is wholesome and inspiring advice, but there is, as always,\r\nanother side to the question. Many a man falls into absurdities and\r\nmistakes because he cannot get outside of himself and look at himself\r\nfrom other people's eyes. We should cultivate the ability to see\r\neverything, including ourselves, from more than one standpoint.\r\n\r\n\r\n  O wad some Pow'r the giftie gie us\r\n    To see oursels as ithers see us!\r\n  It wad frae mony a blunder free us,\r\n    And foolish notion;\r\n  What airs in dress an' gait wad lea'e us,\r\n    And ev'n devotion!\r\n\r\n\r\n_Robert Burns._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROMETHEUS UNBOUND\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the poem from which this excerpt is taken, Prometheus the Titan has\r\nbeen cruelly tortured for opposing the malignant will of Jupiter. In the\r\nend Prometheus wins a complete outward victory. Better still, by his\r\nsteadfastness and high purpose he has won a great inward triumph. The\r\nspirit that has actuated him and the nature of his achievement are\r\nexpressed in the following lines.\r\n\r\n\r\n  To suffer woes which Hope thinks infinite;\r\n  To forgive wrongs darker than death or night;\r\n    To defy Power, which seems omnipotent;\r\n  To love, and bear; to hope till Hope creates\r\n  From its own wreck the thing it contemplates;\r\n    Neither to change, nor falter, nor repent;\r\n  This, like thy glory, Titan, is to be\r\n  Good, great and joyous, beautiful and free;\r\n  This is alone Life, Joy, Empire, and Victory.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Percy Bysshe Shelley._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVICTORY IN DEFEAT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great, radiant souls of earth--the Davids, the Shakespeares, the\r\nLincolns--know grief and affliction as well as joy and triumph. But\r\nadversity is never to them mere adversity; it\r\n\r\n  \"Doth suffer a sea-change\r\n  Into something rich and strange\";\r\n\r\nand in the crucible of character their suffering itself is transmuted\r\ninto song.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Defeat may serve as well as victory\r\n  To shake the soul and let the glory out.\r\n  When the great oak is straining in the wind,\r\n  The boughs drink in new beauty, and the trunk\r\n  Sends down a deeper root on the windward side.\r\n  Only the soul that knows the mighty grief\r\n  Can know the mighty rapture. Sorrows come\r\n  To stretch out spaces in the heart for joy.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Edwin Markham._\r\n\r\nFrom \"The Shoes of Happiness, and Other Poems.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RICHER MINES\r\n\r\n\r\nNo man is so poor but that he is a stockholder. Yet many a man has no\r\nreal riches; his stocks draw dividends in dollars and cents only.\r\n\r\n\r\n  When it comes to buying shares\r\n    In the mines of earth,\r\n  May I join the millionaires\r\n    Who are rich in mirth.\r\n\r\n  Let me have a heavy stake\r\n    In fresh mountain air--\r\n  I will promise now to take\r\n    All that you can spare.\r\n\r\n  When you're setting up your claim\r\n    In the Mines of Glee,\r\n  Don't forget to use my name--\r\n    You can count on me.\r\n\r\n  Nothing better can be won,\r\n    Freer from alloy,\r\n  Than a bouncing claim in \"Con-\r\n    Solidated Joy.\"\r\n\r\n  You can have your Copper Stocks\r\n    Gold and tin and coal--\r\n  What I'd have within my box\r\n    Has to do with Soul.\r\n\r\n_John Kendrick Bangs._\r\n\r\nFrom \"Songs of Cheer.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBRAVE LIFE\r\n\r\n\r\nTo be absolutely without physical fear may not be the highest courage;\r\nto shrink and quake, and yet stand at one's post, may be braver still.\r\nSo of success. It lies less in the attainment of some external end than\r\nin holding yourself to your purposes and ideals; for out of high loyalty\r\nand effort comes that intangible thing called character, which is no\r\nmere symbol of success, but success itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n  I do not know what I shall find on out beyond the final fight;\r\n  I do not know what I shall meet beyond the last barrage of night;\r\n  Nor do I care--but this I know--if I but serve within the fold\r\n  And play the game--I'll be prepared for all the endless years may hold.\r\n\r\n  Life is a training camp at best for what may wait beyond the years;\r\n  A training camp of toiling days and nights that lean to dreams and tears;\r\n  But each may come upon the goal, and build his soul above all Fate\r\n  By holding an unbroken faith and taking Courage for a mate.\r\n\r\n  Is not the fight itself enough that man must look to some behest?\r\n  Wherein does Failure miss Success if all engaged but do their best?\r\n  Where does the Victor's cry come in for wreath of fame or laureled brow\r\n  If one he vanquished fought as well as weaker muscle would allow?\r\n\r\n  If my opponent in the fray should prove to be a stronger foe--\r\n  Not of his making--but because the Destinies ordained it so;\r\n  If he should win--and I should lose--although I did my utmost part,\r\n  Is my reward the less than his if he should strive with equal heart?\r\n\r\n  Brave Life, I hold, is something more than driving upward to the peak;\r\n  Than smashing madly through the strong, and crashing onward through the\r\n            weak;\r\n  I hold the man who makes his fight against the raw game's crushing odds\r\n  Is braver than his brothers are who hold the favor of the gods.\r\n\r\n  On by the sky line, faint and vague, in that Far Country all must know,\r\n  No laurel crown of fame may wait beyond the sunset's glow;\r\n  But life has given me the chance to train and serve within the fold,\r\n  To meet the test--and be prepared for all the endless years may hold.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Grantland Rice._\r\n\r\nFrom \"The Sportlight.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA SONG OF TO-MORROW\r\n\r\n\r\nA night's sleep and a new day--these are excellent things to look\r\nforward to when one is weary or in trouble.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Li'l bit er trouble,\r\n    Honey, fer terday;\r\n  Yander come Termorrer--\r\n    Shine it all away!\r\n\r\n  Rainy Sky is sayin',\r\n    \"Dis'll never do!\r\n  Fetch dem rainbow ribbons,\r\n    En I'll dress in blue!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Frank L. Stanton._\r\n\r\nFrom \"The Atlanta Constitution.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GLAD SONG\r\n\r\n\r\nGladness begins with the first person, with you. But it may spread far,\r\nlike the ripples when you toss a stone in the water.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Sing a song, sing a song,\r\n  Ring the glad-bells all along;\r\n  Smile at him who frowns at you,\r\n  He will smile and then they're two.\r\n\r\n  Laugh a bit, laugh a bit,\r\n  Folks will soon be catching it,\r\n  Can't resist a happy face;\r\n  World will be a merry place.\r\n\r\n  Laugh a Bit and Sing a Song,\r\n  Where they are there's nothing wrong;\r\n  Joy will dance the whole world through,\r\n  But it must begin with you.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Joseph Morris._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPAINTING THE LILY\r\n\r\n\r\nMany people are not content to let well enough alone, but spoil what\r\nthey have by striving for an unnecessary and foolish improvement. If\r\nthey have a rich title, they try to ornament it still further; if they\r\nhave refined gold, they try to gild it; if they have a lily, they try to\r\npaint it into still purer color.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Therefore, to be possessed with double pomp,\r\n  To guard a title that was rich before,\r\n  To gild refined gold, to paint the lily,\r\n  To throw a perfume on the violet,\r\n  To smooth the ice, or add another hue\r\n  Unto the rainbow, or with taper-light\r\n  To seek the beauteous eye of heaven to garnish,\r\n  Is wasteful and ridiculous excess.\r\n\r\n\r\n_William Shakespeare._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA PRETTY GOOD WORLD\r\n\r\n\r\nThe world has its faults, but few of us would give it up till we have\r\nto.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Pretty good world if you take it all round--\r\n    Pretty good world, good people!\r\n  Better be on than under the ground--\r\n    Pretty good world, good people!\r\n  Better be here where the skies are as blue\r\n    As the eyes of your sweetheart a-smilin' at you--\r\n  Better than lyin' 'neath daisies and dew--\r\n    Pretty good world, good people!\r\n\r\n  Pretty good world with its hopes and its fears--\r\n    Pretty good world, good people!\r\n  Sun twinkles bright through the rain of its tears--\r\n    Pretty good world, good people!\r\n  Better be here, in the pathway you know--\r\n    Where the thorn's in the garden where sweet roses grow,\r\n  Than to rest where you feel not the fall o' the snow--\r\n    Pretty good world, good people!\r\n\r\n  Pretty good world! Let us sing it that way--\r\n    Pretty good world, good people!\r\n  Make up your mind that you're in it to stay--\r\n    At least for a season, good people!\r\n  Pretty good world, with its dark and its bright--\r\n    Pretty good world, with its love and its light;\r\n  Sing it that way till you whisper, \"Good-night!\"--\r\n    Pretty good world, good people!\r\n\r\n\r\n_Frank L. Stanton._\r\n\r\nFrom \"The Atlanta Constitution.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nODE TO DUTY\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the first stanza the poet hails duty as coming from God. It is a\r\nlight to guide us and a rod to check. To obey it does not lead to\r\nvictory; to obey it _is_ victory--is to live by a high, noble law. In\r\nthe second stanza he admits that some people do right without driving\r\nthemselves to it--do it by instinct and \"the genial sense of youth.\" In\r\nstanza 3 he looks forward to a time when all people will be thus\r\nblessed, but he thinks that as yet it is unsafe for most of us to lose\r\ntouch completely with stern, commanding duty. In stanzas 4 and 5 he\r\nstates that he himself has been too impatient of control, has wearied\r\nhimself by changing from one desire to another, and now wishes to\r\nregulate his life by some great abiding principle. In stanza 6 he\r\ndeclares that duty, though stern, is benignant; the flowers bloom in\r\nobedience to it, and the stars keep their places. In the final stanza he\r\ndedicates his life to its service.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Stern Daughter of the Voice of God!\r\n    O Duty! if that name thou love\r\n    Who art a light to guide, a rod\r\n    To check the erring, and reprove;\r\n    Thou who art victory and law\r\n    When empty terrors overawe;\r\n    From vain temptations dost set free,\r\n  And calm'st the weary strife of frail humanity!\r\n\r\n    There are who ask not if thine eye\r\n    Be on them; who, in love and truth\r\n    Where no misgiving is, rely\r\n    Upon the genial sense of youth:\r\n    Glad hearts! without reproach or blot,\r\n    Who do thy work, and know it not:\r\n    Oh! if through confidence misplaced\r\n  They fail, thy saving arms, dread Power! around them cast.\r\n\r\n    Serene will be our days and bright\r\n    And happy will our nature be\r\n    When love is an unerring light,\r\n    And joy its own security.\r\n    And they a blissful course may hold\r\n    Ev'n now, who, not unwisely bold,\r\n    Live in the spirit of this creed;\r\n  Yet seek thy firm support, according to their need.\r\n\r\n    I, loving freedom, and untried,\r\n    No sport of every random gust,\r\n    Yet being to myself a guide,\r\n    Too blindly have reposed my trust:\r\n    And oft, when in my heart was heard\r\n    Thy timely mandate, I deferr'd\r\n    The task, in smoother walks to stray;\r\n  But thee I now would serve more strictly, if I may.\r\n\r\n    Through no disturbance of my soul\r\n    Or strong compunction in me wrought,\r\n    I supplicate for thy control,\r\n    But in the quietness of thought:\r\n    Me this uncharter'd freedom tires;\r\n    I feel the weight of chance-desires:\r\n    My hopes no more must change their name;\r\n  I long for a repose that ever is the same.\r\n\r\n    Stern Lawgiver! yet thou dost wear\r\n    The Godhead's most benignant grace,\r\n    Nor know we anything so fair\r\n    As is the smile upon thy face;\r\n    Flowers laugh before thee on their beds,\r\n    And fragrance in thy footing treads;\r\n    Thou dost preserve the Stars from wrong;\r\n  And the most ancient Heavens, through Thee, are fresh and strong.\r\n\r\n    To humbler functions, awful Power!\r\n    I call thee: I myself commend\r\n    Unto thy guidance from this hour;\r\n    Oh let my weakness have an end!\r\n    Give unto me, made lowly wise,\r\n    The spirit of self-sacrifice;\r\n    The confidence of reason give;\r\n  And in the light of truth thy Bondman let me live.\r\n\r\n\r\n_William Wordsworth._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SYNDICATED SMILE\r\n\r\n\r\nA ready and sincere friendliness is the one thing we can show to every\r\nhuman being, whether we know him or not. The world is full of perplexed\r\nand lonely people whom even a smile or a kind look will help. Yet that\r\nwhich is so easy to give we too often reserve for a few, and those\r\nperhaps the least appreciative.\r\n\r\n\r\n  I knew a girl who had a beau\r\n  And his name wasn't Adams--\r\n  No child of hers would ever call\r\n  The present writer \"daddums.\"\r\n  I didn't love the girl, but still\r\n  I found her most beguiling;\r\n  And so did all the other chaps--\r\n  She did it with her smiling.\r\n  \"I'm not a one-man girl,\" she said--\r\n  \"Of smiles my beau first took his;\r\n  But some are left; I'll syndicate\r\n  And pass them round like cookies.\"\r\n\r\n        That syndicated smile!\r\n      When trouble seemed the most in style,\r\n      It heartened us--\r\n              That indicated,\r\n                      Syndicated\r\n                              Smile.\r\n\r\n  It's not enough to please your boss\r\n  Or fawn round folks with bankrolls;\r\n  Be just as friendly to the guys\r\n  Whose homespun round their shank rolls.\r\n  The best investment in the world\r\n  Is goodwill, twenty carat;\r\n  It costs you nothing, brings returns;\r\n  So get yours out and air it.\r\n  A niggard of good nature cheats\r\n  Himself and wrongs his fellows.\r\n  You'd serve mankind? Then be less close\r\n  With friendly nods and helloes.\r\n\r\n        The syndicated smile!\r\n      If you have kept it all the while,\r\n      You've vindicated\r\n              The indicated,\r\n                      Syndicated\r\n                              Smile.\r\n\r\n\r\n_St. Clair Adams._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFAIRY SONG\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great beneficent forces of life are not exhausted when once used,\r\nbut are recurrent. The sun rises afresh each new day. Once a year the\r\nspringtime returns and \"God renews His ancient rapture.\" So it is with\r\nour joys. They do not stay by us constantly; they pass from us and are\r\ngone; but we need not trouble ourselves--they are sure to come back.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Shed no tear! O shed no tear!\r\n  The flower will bloom another year.\r\n  Weep no more! O weep no more!\r\n  Young buds sleep in the root's white core.\r\n  Dry your eyes! O dry your eyes,\r\n  For I was taught in Paradise\r\n  To ease my breast of melodies--\r\n      Shed no tear.\r\n\r\n  Overhead! look overhead,\r\n  'Mong the blossoms white and red--\r\n  Look up, look up--I flutter now\r\n  On this flush pomegranate bough.\r\n  See me! 'tis this silvery bill\r\n  Ever cures the good man's ill.\r\n  Shed no tear! O shed no tear!\r\n  The flowers will bloom another year.\r\n  Adieu, adieu--I fly, adieu,\r\n  I vanish in the heaven's blue--\r\n      Adieu, adieu!\r\n\r\n\r\n_John Keats._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRAISE THE GENEROUS GODS FOR GIVING\r\n\r\n\r\nSome of us find joy in toil, some in art, some in the open air and the\r\nsunshine. All of us find it in simply being alive. Life is the gift no\r\ncreature in his right mind would part with. As Milton asks,\r\n\r\n  \"For who would lose,\r\n  Though full of pain, this intellectual being,\r\n  These thoughts that wander through eternity,\r\n  To perish rather, swallowed up and lost\r\n  In the wide womb of uncreated night,\r\n  Devoid of sense and motion?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n  Praise the generous gods for giving\r\n    In a world of wrath and strife,\r\n  With a little time for living,\r\n    Unto all the joy of life.\r\n\r\n  At whatever source we drink it,\r\n    Art or love or faith or wine,\r\n  In whatever terms we think it,\r\n    It is common and divine.\r\n\r\n  Praise the high gods, for in giving\r\n    This to man, and this alone,\r\n  They have made his chance of living\r\n    Shine the equal of their own.\r\n\r\n\r\n_William Ernest Henley._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOWARDS\r\n\r\n\r\nWe might as well accept the inevitable as the inevitable. There is no\r\nescaping death or taxes.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Cowards die many times before their deaths:\r\n  The valiant never taste of death but once.\r\n  Of all the wonders that I yet have heard,\r\n  It seems to me most strange that men should fear;\r\n  Seeing that death, a necessary end,\r\n  Will come, when it will come.\r\n\r\n\r\n_William Shakespeare._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WORD\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Cumaean sibyl offered Tarquin the Proud nine books for what seemed\r\nan exorbitant sum. He refused. She burned three of the books, and placed\r\nthe same price on the six as on the original nine. Again he refused. She\r\nburned three more books, and offered the remainder for the sum she first\r\nnamed. This time Tarquin accepted. The books were found to contain\r\nprophecies and invaluable directions regarding Roman policy, but alas,\r\nthey were no longer complete. So it is with joy. To take it now is to\r\nget it in its entirety.

Two men were falling from an aeroplane. \"I'll bet you\r\nfive dollars,\" said one, \"that I hit the ground first.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    To take things as they be--\r\n    Thet's my philosophy.\r\n  No use to holler, mope, or cuss--\r\n  If they was changed they might be wuss.\r\n\r\n    If rain is pourin' down,\r\n    An' lightnin' buzzin' roun',\r\n  I ain't a-fearin' we'll be hit,\r\n  But grin thet I ain't out in it.\r\n\r\n    If I got deep in debt--\r\n    It hasn't happened yet--\r\n  And owed a man two dollars, Gee!\r\n  Why I'd be glad it wasn't three.\r\n\r\n    If some one come along,\r\n    And tried to do me wrong,\r\n  Why I should sort of take a whim\r\n  To thank the Lord I wasn't him.\r\n\r\n    I never seen a night\r\n    So dark there wasn't light\r\n  Somewheres about if I took care\r\n  To strike a match and find out where.\r\n\r\n\r\n_John Kendrick Bangs._\r\n\r\nFrom \"Songs of Cheer.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LIFE WITHOUT PASSION\r\n\r\n\r\nA person may feel deeply without shouting his emotion to the skies, or\r\nbe strong without seizing occasions to exhibit his strength. In truth we\r\ndistrust the power which makes too much a display of itself. Let it\r\nexert itself only to the point of securing the ends that are really\r\nnecessary. Restraint, self-control are in truth more mighty than might\r\nunshackled, just as a self-possessed opponent is more dangerous than a\r\nfrenzied one. Moreover, there is a moral side to the question. A good\r\nquality, if abused or allowed free sway, becomes a force for evil and\r\ndoes its owner more harm than if he had not possessed it in the first\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n\r\n  They that have power to hurt, and will do none,\r\n  That do not do the thing they most do show,\r\n  Who, moving others, are themselves as stone,\r\n  Unmoved, cold, and to temptation slow,--\r\n\r\n  They rightly do inherit heaven's graces,\r\n  And husband nature's riches from expense;\r\n  They are the lords and owners of their faces,\r\n  Others, but stewards of their excellence.\r\n\r\n  The summer's flower is to the summer sweet,\r\n  Though to itself it only live and die;\r\n  But if that flower with base infection meet,\r\n  The basest weed outbraves his dignity:\r\n\r\n  For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds;\r\n  Lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds.\r\n\r\n\r\n_William Shakespeare._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARACTER OF A HAPPY LIFE\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I'd rather be right than President,\" said Henry Clay. It is to men who\r\nare animated by this spirit that the greatest satisfaction in life\r\ncomes. For true blessedness does not lie far off and above us. It is\r\nclose at hand. Booker T. Washington once told a story of a ship that had\r\nexhausted its supply of fresh water and signaled its need to a passing\r\nvessel. The reply was, \"Send down your buckets where you are.\" Thinking\r\nthere was some misunderstanding, the captain repeated his signal, only\r\nto be answered as before. This time he did as he was bidden and secured\r\nan abundance of fresh water. His ship was opposite the mouth of a mighty\r\nriver which still kept its current unmingled with the waters of the\r\nocean.\r\n\r\n\r\n  How happy is he born and taught\r\n    That serveth not another's will;\r\n  Whose armor is his honest thought\r\n    And simple truth his utmost skill!\r\n\r\n  Whose passions not his masters are,\r\n    Whose soul is still prepared for death,\r\n  Not tied unto the world with care\r\n    Of public fame or private breath;\r\n\r\n  Who envies none that chance doth raise\r\n    Or vice; who never understood\r\n  How deepest wounds are given by praise\r\n    Nor rules of state, but rules of good;\r\n\r\n  Who hath his life from rumors freed,\r\n    Whose conscience is his strong retreat;\r\n  Whose state can neither flatterers feed,\r\n    Nor ruin make accusers great;\r\n\r\n  Who God doth late and early pray\r\n    More of his grace than gifts to lend;\r\n  And entertains the harmless day\r\n    With a well-chosen book or friend;\r\n\r\n --This man is freed from servile bands\r\n    Of hope to rise or fear to fall;\r\n  Lord of himself, though not of lands;\r\n    And having nothing, yet hath all.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sir Henry Wotton._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nESSENTIALS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe things here named are essential to a happy and successful life.

First, commit something good to memory each day. Three or four\r\nwords will do, just a pretty bit of poem, or a Bible verse. Do you\r\nunderstand?\" A girl jumped up. \"I know; you want us to learn something\r\nwe'd be glad to remember if we went blind.\" Mrs. Palmer was relieved;\r\nthese children understood. She gave the three rules--memorize something\r\ngood each day, see something beautiful each day, do something helpful\r\neach day. When the children reported at the end of the week, not a\r\nsingle day had any of them lost. But hard put to it to obey her? Indeed\r\nthey had been. One girl, kept for twenty-four hours within squalid\r\nhome-walls by a rain, had nevertheless seen two beautiful things--a\r\nsparrow taking a bath in the gutter, and a gleam of sunlight on a baby's\r\nhair.\r\n\r\n\r\n  If you sit down at set of sun\r\n     And count the acts that you have done,\r\n     And, counting, find\r\n  One self-denying deed, one word\r\n  That eased the heart of him who heard--\r\n     One glance most kind,\r\n  That fell like sunshine where it went--\r\n  Then you may count that day well spent.\r\n\r\n  But if, through all the livelong day,\r\n  You've cheered no heart, by yea or nay--\r\n     If, through it all\r\n  You've nothing done that you can trace\r\n  That brought the sunshine to one face--\r\n     No act most small\r\n  That helped some soul and nothing cost--\r\n  Then count that day as worse than lost.\r\n\r\n\r\n_George Eliot_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSADNESS AND MERRIMENT\r\n\r\n(ADAPTED FROM \"THE MERCHANT OF VENICE\")\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this passage Antonio states that he is overcome by a sadness he\r\ncannot account for. Salarino tells him that the mental attitude is\r\neverything; that mirth is as easy as gloom; that nature in her\r\nfreakishness makes some men laugh at trifles until their eyes become\r\nmere slits, yet leaves others dour and unsmiling before jests that would\r\nconvulse even the venerable Nestor. Gratiano maintains that Antonio is\r\ntoo absorbed in worldly affairs, and that he must not let his spirits\r\ngrow sluggish or irritable.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _ANT._     In sooth, I know not why I am so sad:\r\n  It wearies me; you say it wearies you;\r\n  But how I caught it, found it, or came by it,\r\n  What stuff 'tis made of, whereof it is born,\r\n  I am to learn.\r\n\r\n  _Salar_.     Then let's say you are sad\r\n  Because you are not merry: and 'twere as easy\r\n  For you to laugh and leap, and say you are merry,\r\n  Because you are not sad. Now, by two-headed Janus,\r\n  Nature hath framed strange fellows in her time:\r\n  Some that will evermore peep through their eyes\r\n  And laugh like parrots at a bag-piper,\r\n  And other of such vinegar aspect\r\n  That they'll not show their teeth in way of smile,\r\n  Though Nestor swear the jest be laughable.\r\n\r\n  _Gra_.    You look not well, Signior Antonio;\r\n  You have too much respect upon the world:\r\n  They lose it that do buy it with much care:\r\n  Believe me, you are marvelously changed.\r\n\r\n  _Ant_.    I hold the world but as the world, Gratiano\r\n  A stage where every man must play a part,\r\n  And mine a sad one.\r\n\r\n  _Gra_.    Let me play the fool:\r\n  With mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come,\r\n  And let my liver rather heat with wine\r\n  Than my heart cool with mortifying groans.\r\n  Why should a man whose blood is warm within\r\n  Sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster?\r\n  Sleep when he wakes, and creep into a jaundice\r\n  By being peevish?   Fare ye well awhile:\r\n  I'll end my exhortation after dinner.\r\n\r\n\r\n_William Shakespeare._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPRECIATION\r\n\r\n\r\n  Life's a bully good game with its kicks and cuffs--\r\n    Some smile, some laugh, some bluff;\r\n  Some carry a load too heavy to bear\r\n    While some push on with never a care,\r\n  But the load will seldom heavy be\r\n    When I appreciate you and you appreciate me.\r\n\r\n  He who lives by the side of the road\r\n    And helps to bear his brother's load\r\n  May seem to travel lone and long\r\n    While the world goes by with a merry song,\r\n  But the heart grows warm and sorrows flee\r\n    When I appreciate you and you appreciate me.\r\n\r\n  When I appreciate you and you appreciate me,\r\n    The road seems short to victory;\r\n  It buoys one up and calls \"Come on,\"\r\n    And days grow brighter with the dawn;\r\n  There is no doubt or mystery\r\n    When I appreciate you and you appreciate me.\r\n\r\n  It's the greatest thought in heaven or earth--\r\n    It helps us know our fellow's worth;\r\n  There'd be no wars or bitterness,\r\n    No fear, no hate, no grasping; yes,\r\n  It makes work play, and the careworn free\r\n    When I appreciate you and you appreciate me.\r\n\r\n\r\n_William Judson Kibby,_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKEEP SWEET\r\n\r\n\r\nEven the direst catastrophes may be softened by our attitude to them.\r\nCharles II said to those who had gathered about his deathbed: \"You'll\r\npardon any little lapses, gentlemen.

After a work is finished, even though it be a good work which our\r\nfinal judgment will approve, we are likely to be oppressed for a time by\r\nthe anxieties we have passed through; the comfort of effort has left us,\r\nand we recall our dreams, our intentions, beside which our actual\r\nachievement seems small. In such moments we should remember that just\r\nafter the delivery of the Gettysburg Address Lincoln believed it an\r\nutter failure. Yet the address was a masterpiece of commemorative\r\noratory.\r\n\r\n\r\n  We cannot kindle when we will\r\n    The fire which in the heart resides;\r\n  The spirit bloweth and is still,\r\n  In mystery our soul abides.\r\n    But tasks in hours of insight will'd\r\n    Can be through hours of gloom fulfill'd\r\n\r\n  With aching hands and bleeding feet\r\n  We dig and heap, lay stone on stone;\r\n  We bear the burden and the heat\r\n  Of the long day and wish 'twere done.\r\n    Not till the hours of light return,\r\n    All we have built do we discern.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Matthew Arnold_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA HYMN TO HAPPINESS\r\n\r\n\r\nA man who owed Artemus Ward two hundred dollars fell into such hard\r\ncircumstances that Artemus offered to knock off half the debt. \"I won't\r\nlet you outdo me in generosity,\" said the man; \"I'll knock off the other\r\nhalf.\" Similarly, when we resolve to live down our causes of gloom, fate\r\ncomes to our aid and removes most of them altogether.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Let us smile along together,\r\n  Be the weather\r\n    What it may.\r\n  Through the waste and wealth of hours,\r\n  Plucking flowers\r\n    By the way.\r\n  Fragrance from the meadows blowing,\r\n  Naught of heat or hatred knowing,\r\n  Kindness seeking, kindness sowing,\r\n    Not to-morrow, but to-day.\r\n\r\n  Let us sing along, beguiling\r\n  Grief to smiling\r\n    In the song.\r\n  With the promises of heaven\r\n  Let us leaven\r\n    The day long,\r\n  Gilding all the duller seemings\r\n  With the roselight of our dreamings,\r\n  Splashing clouds with sunlight's gleamings,\r\n    Here and there and all along.\r\n\r\n  Let us live along, the sorrow\r\n  Of to-morrow\r\n    Never heed.\r\n  In the pages of the present\r\n  What is pleasant\r\n    Only read.\r\n  Bells but pealing, never knelling,\r\n  Hearts with gladness ever swelling.\r\n  Tides of charity up welling\r\n    In our every dream and deed.\r\n\r\n  Let us hope along together,\r\n  Be the weather\r\n      What it may,\r\n  Where the sunlight glad is shining,\r\n  Not repining\r\n      By the way.\r\n  Seek to add our meed and measure\r\n  To the old Earth's joy and treasure,\r\n  Quaff the crystal cup of pleasure,\r\n      Not to-morrow, but to-day.\r\n\r\n\r\n_James W.

Stanton._\r\n\r\nFrom \"The Atlanta Constitution.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN EARTH'S LAST PICTURE IS PAINTED\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is it that a human being wants? Most of us have something that we\r\nlike to do more than anything else. We are not free to do it as we wish.\r\nWe are handicapped by the need to earn a living, by physical weariness,\r\nby the carpings and scoffs of the envious, by the limited time we have\r\nat our disposal. But underneath all this is _the spirit of work_--the\r\ndesire to take up our task for its own sake alone, to give our whole\r\nselves to it, to carry it through, not in some partial way, but in\r\naccordance with the fulness of our dream. We want to be free from\r\ndistractions and interruptions; if we are driven at all, we want it to\r\nbe by our own inner promptings, not by obligation or necessity. Of\r\ncourse these favorable, these ideal conditions belong to heaven, not to\r\nearth. Kipling here explains what they will mean to the artist, the\r\npainter; but in doing so he expresses the longings of the true workman\r\nof whatsoever sort--he sums up the true spirit of work.\r\n\r\n\r\n  When Earth's last picture is painted and the tubes are twisted and dried,\r\n  When the oldest colors have faded, and the youngest critic has died,\r\n  We shall rest, and, faith, we shall need it--lie down for an aeon or two,\r\n  Till the Master of All Good Workmen shall set us to work anew.\r\n\r\n  And those that were good will be happy: they shall sit in a golden chair;\r\n  They shall splash at a ten-league canvas with brushes of comets' hair.\r\n  They shall find real saints to draw from--Magdalene, Peter, and Paul;\r\n  They shall work for an age at a sitting and never be tired at all!\r\n\r\n  And only the Master shall praise us, and only the Master shall blame;\r\n  And no one shall work for money, and no one shall work for fame,\r\n  But each for the joy of the working, and each, in his separate star,\r\n  Shall draw the Thing as he sees It for the God of Things as They are!\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rudyard Kipling._\r\n\r\nFrom \"Rudyard Kipling's Verse, 1885-1918.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX BY AUTHORS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA\r\n\r\nADAMS, ST.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg\u2122\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\u2122\u2019s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\u2122 collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg\u2122 and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\u2019s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\u2019s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\u2019s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\u2122 electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg\u2122 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\u2122 eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\u2122,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "Document"}, "__type__": "4"}}}
