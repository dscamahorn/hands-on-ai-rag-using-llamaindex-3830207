CLAIR ADAMS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOREWORD\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a volume of inspirational poems. Its purpose is to bring men\r\ncourage and resolution, to cheer them, to fire them with new confidence\r\nwhen they grow dispirited, to strengthen their faith that THINGS CAN BE\r\nDONE. It is better for this purpose than the entire works of any one\r\npoet, for it takes the cream of many and has greater diversity than any\r\none writer can show.\r\n\r\nIt is made up chiefly of very recent poems--not such as were written for\r\nanthologies of poetical \"gems,\" but such as speak directly to the heart,\r\nalways in very simple language, often in the phrases of shop or office\r\nor street. Included, however, with the poems of the day are a few of the\r\nfine old pieces that have been of comfort to men through the ages.\r\n\r\nBesides the poems themselves, the volume contains helps to their\r\nunderstanding and enjoyment. The pieces are introduced by short\r\ncomments; these serve the same purpose as the strain played by the\r\npianist before the singer begins to sing; they create a mood, give a\r\npoint of view, throw light on the meaning of what follows. Also the\r\nlives of the authors are briefly summarized; this is in answer to our\r\nnatural interest in the writer of a poem we like, and in the case of\r\nliving poets it brings together facts hardly to be found anywhere else.\r\n\r\nFinally, the book is not one to be read and then cast aside. It is to be\r\nkept as a constant companion and an unfailing recourse in weariness or\r\ngloom. Human companions are not always in the mood to cheer us, and may\r\ntalk upon themes we dislike. But this book will converse or be silent,\r\nit is never out of sorts or discouraged, and so far from being wed to\r\nsome single topic, it will speak to us at any time on any subject we\r\ndesire.\r\n\r\nTo many authors and publishers acknowledgment is due for generous\r\npermission to use copyright material.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nAbou Ben Adhem............................. _Leigh Hunt_\r\nAnswer, The................................ _Grantland Rice_\r\nAppreciation............................... _William Judson Kibby_\r\nArrow and the Song, The.................... _Henry Wadsworth Longfellow_\r\nAwareness.................................. _Miriam Teichner_\r\n\r\nBars of Fate, The.......................... _Ellen M.H.

Yet success is not occupying a lofty place\r\nor doing conspicuous work; it is being the best that is in you.

Various people have given\r\nvarious answers to this question. Here the poet states what qualities he\r\nthinks indispensable.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Four things a man must learn to do\r\n  If he would make his record true:\r\n  To think without confusion clearly;\r\n  To love his fellow-men sincerely;\r\n  To act from honest motives purely;\r\n  To trust in God and Heaven securely.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Henry Van Dyke._\r\n\r\nFrom \"Collected Poems.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIF\r\n\r\n\r\nThe central idea of this poem is that success comes from self-control\r\nand a true sense of the values of things. In extremes lies danger. A man\r\nmust not lose heart because of doubts or opposition, yet he must do his\r\nbest to see the grounds for both. He must not be deceived into thinking\r\neither triumph or disaster final; he must use each wisely--and push on.\r\nIn all things he must hold to the golden mean. If he does, he will own\r\nthe world, and even better, for his personal reward he will attain the\r\nfull stature of manhood.\r\n\r\n\r\n  If you can keep your head when all about you\r\n    Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,\r\n  If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,\r\n    But make allowance for their doubting too;\r\n  If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,\r\n    Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,\r\n  Or being hated don't give way to hating,\r\n    And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:\r\n\r\n  If you can dream--and not make dreams your master;\r\n    If you can think--and not make thoughts your aim,\r\n  If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster\r\n    And treat those two imposters just the same;\r\n  If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken\r\n    Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,\r\n  Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,\r\n    And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:\r\n\r\n  If you can make one heap of all your winnings\r\n    And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,\r\n  And lose, and start again at your beginnings\r\n    And never breathe a word about your loss;\r\n  If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew\r\n    To serve your turn long after they are gone,\r\n  And so", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 19819, "end_char_idx": 23722, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, {"__data__": {"id_": "dde8063b-0a48-4f1e-a96f-86b85123b615", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "../02_Fundamental_Concepts_in_LlamaIndex/data/pg10763.txt", "file_name": "pg10763.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 405245, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-05"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "../02_Fundamental_Concepts_in_LlamaIndex/data/pg10763.txt", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "../02_Fundamental_Concepts_in_LlamaIndex/data/pg10763.txt", "file_name": "pg10763.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 405245, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-05"}, "hash": "7ed8c6d21497c7614e40a55a120dca129c90f1a385c21a5c9e8c1c26e753f43d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f76d60e1-475e-41b3-a296-efc68c487153", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "../02_Fundamental_Concepts_in_LlamaIndex/data/pg10763.txt", "file_name": "pg10763.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 405245, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-05"}, "hash": "6d4509df77d99402dcb88d9457bf792a8158ef84f41d8f7b5e4bae23ca60ffb9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "dccfbe80-efac-4930-98f1-c1dd4b301657", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c1132fcd92f0063105a52ea26cd3c28ba951f163f9a1fe7c1db9fc4f32778e55", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "To serve your turn long after they are gone,\r\n  And so hold on when there is nothing in you\r\n    Except the Will which says to them; \"Hold on!\"\r\n\r\n  If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,\r\n    Or walk with Kings--nor lose the common touch,\r\n  If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,\r\n    If all men count with you, but none too much;\r\n  If you can fill the unforgiving minute\r\n    With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,\r\n  Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,\r\n    And--which is more--you'll be a Man, my son!\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rudyard Kipling._\r\n\r\nFrom \"Rudyard Kipling's Verse, 1885-1918.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINVICTUS\r\n\r\n\r\nTriumph in spirit over adverse conditions is the keynote of this poem of\r\ncourage undismayed.

But\r\nbefore it has been done, it is called impossible. One reason why people\r\nfear to embark upon great enterprises is that they see all the\r\ndifficulties at once. They know they could succeed in the initial tasks,\r\nbut they shrink from what is to follow. Yet \"a thing begun is half\r\ndone.\" Moreover the surmounting of the first barrier gives strength and\r\ningenuity for the harder ones beyond. Mountains viewed from a distance\r\nseem to be unscalable. But they can be climbed, and the way to begin is\r\nto take the first upward step. From that moment the mountains are less\r\nhigh. As Hannibal led his army across the foothills, then among the\r\nupper ranges, and finally over the loftiest peaks and passes of the\r\nAlps, or as Peary pushed farther and farther into the solitudes that\r\nencompass the North Pole, so can you achieve any purpose whatsoever if\r\nyou heed not the doubters, meet each problem as it arises, and keep ever\r\nwith you the assurance _It Can Be Done_.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Somebody said that it couldn't be done,\r\n    But he with a chuckle replied\r\n  That \"maybe it couldn't,\" but he would be one\r\n    Who wouldn't say so till he'd tried.\r\n  So he buckled right in with the trace of a grin\r\n    On his face. If he worried he hid it.\r\n  He started to sing as he tackled the thing\r\n    That couldn't be done, and he did it.\r\n\r\n  Somebody scoffed: \"Oh, you'll never do that;\r\n    At least no one ever has done it\";\r\n  But he took off his coat and he took off his hat,\r\n    And the first thing we knew he'd begun it.\r\n  With a lift of his chin and a bit of a grin,\r\n    Without any doubting or quiddit,\r\n  He started to sing as he tackled the thing\r\n    That couldn't be done, and he did it.\r\n\r\n  There are thousands to tell you it cannot be done,\r\n    There are thousands to prophesy failure;\r\n  There are thousands to point out to you one by one,\r\n    The dangers that wait to assail you.\r\n  But just buckle in with a bit of a grin,\r\n    Just take off your coat and go to it;\r\n  Just start to sing as you tackle the thing\r\n    That \"cannot be done,\" and you'll do it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Edgar A.

Just as a tree when sawed\r\ndown has the record of its age in the number of its rings, so does the\r\nnautilus measure its age by the ever-widening compartments of its shell.\r\nThese it has successively occupied.

As Wordsworth says of Peter\r\nBell,\r\n\r\n  \"A primrose by the river's brim\r\n  A yellow primrose was to him,\r\n  And it was nothing more.\"\r\n\r\nBut to stop now and then and realize that the world is fresh and buoyant\r\nand happy, will do much to keep the spirit young.

Certain it is that nobody need hang back\r\nfrom want of something to do, to promote, to assail, to protect, to\r\nendure, or to sympathize with.\r\n\r\n\r\n  There will always be something to do, my boy;\r\n    There will always be wrongs to right;\r\n  There will always be need for a manly breed\r\n    And men unafraid to fight.\r\n  There will always be honor to guard, my boy;\r\n    There will always be hills to climb,\r\n  And tasks to do, and battles new\r\n    From now till the end of time.\r\n\r\n  There will always be dangers to face, my boy;\r\n    There will always be goals to take;\r\n  Men shall be tried, when the roads divide,\r\n    And proved by the choice they make.\r\n  There will always be burdens to bear, my boy;\r\n    There will always be need to pray;\r\n  There will always be tears through the future years,\r\n    As loved ones are borne away.\r\n\r\n  There will always be God to serve, my boy,\r\n    And always the Flag above;\r\n  They shall call to you until life is through\r\n    For courage and strength and love.\r\n  So these are things that I dream, my boy,\r\n    And have dreamed since your life began:\r\n  That whatever befalls, when the old world calls,\r\n    It shall find you a sturdy man.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Edgar A.

And guarantee yourself against being false to others by setting up\r\nthe high moral principle of being true to yourself.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Give thy thoughts no tongue,\r\n  Nor any unproportion'd thought his act.\r\n  Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar;\r\n  The friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,\r\n  Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel;\r\n  But do not dull thy palm with entertainment\r\n  Of each new-hatch'd, unfledg'd comrade. Beware\r\n  Of entrance to a quarrel, but, being in,\r\n  Bear 't that th' opposed may beware of thee.\r\n  Give every man thine ear, but few thy voice;\r\n  Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.\r\n  Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,\r\n  But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;\r\n  For the apparel oft proclaims the man.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  Neither a borrower, nor a lender be;\r\n  For loan oft loses both itself and friend,\r\n  And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.\r\n  This above all: to thine own self be true,\r\n  And it must follow, as the night the day,\r\n  Thou canst not then be false to any man.\r\n\r\n\r\n_William Shakespeare._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW DO YOU TACKLE YOUR WORK?\r\n\r\n\r\nIt would be foolish to begin digging a tunnel through a mountain with a\r\nmere pick and spade. We must assemble for the task great mechanical\r\ncontrivances. And so with our energies of will; a slight tool means a\r\nslight achievement; a huge, aggressive engine, driving on at full blast,\r\nmeans corresponding bigness of results.\r\n\r\n\r\n  How do you tackle your work each day?\r\n    Are you scared of the job you find?\r\n  Do you grapple the task that comes your way\r\n    With a confident, easy mind?\r\n  Do you stand right up to the work ahead\r\n    Or fearfully pause to view it?\r\n  Do you start to toil with a sense of dread\r\n    Or feel that you're going to do it?\r\n\r\n  You can do as much as you think you can,\r\n    But you'll never accomplish more;\r\n  If you're afraid of yourself, young man,\r\n    There's little for you in store.\r\n  For failure comes from the inside first,\r\n    It's there if we only knew it,\r\n  And you can win, though you face the worst,\r\n    If you feel that you're going to do it.\r\n\r\n  Success! It's found in the soul of you,\r\n    And not in the realm of luck!\r\n  The world will furnish the work to do,\r\n    But you must provide the pluck.\r\n  You can do whatever you think you can,\r\n    It's all in the way you view it.\r\n  It's all in the start you make, young man:\r\n    You must feel that you're going to do it.\r\n\r\n  How do you tackle your work each day?\r\n    With confidence clear, or dread?\r\n  What to yourself do you stop and say\r\n    When a new task lies ahead?\r\n  What is the thought that is in your mind?\r\n    Is fear ever running through it?\r\n  If so, just tackle the next you find\r\n    By thinking you're going to do it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Edgar A.

But\r\nit could not serve its full purpose without the presence, here and\r\nthere, of older poems--of \"classics.\" These express a truth, a mood, or\r\na spirit that is universal, and they express it in words of noble\r\ndignity and beauty. They are not always easy to understand; they are\r\ncrops we must patiently cultivate, not crops that volunteer. But they\r\nwear well; they grow upon us; we come back to them again and again, and\r\nstill they are fresh, living, significant--not empty, meaningless, and\r\nweather-worn, like a last year's crow's nest.\r\n\r\nSuch a poem is _Ulysses_. It is shot through and through with the spirit\r\nof strenuous and never-ceasing endeavor--a spirit manifest in a hero who\r\nhas every temptation to rest and enjoy. Ulysses is old. After ten long\r\nyears of warfare before Troy, after endless misfortunes on his homeward\r\nvoyage, after travels and experiences that have taken him everywhere and\r\nshown him everything that men know and do, he has returned to his rude\r\nnative kingdom. He is reunited with his wife Penelope and his son\r\nTelemachus. He is rich and famous. Yet he is unsatisfied. The task and\r\nroutine of governing a slow, materially minded people, though suited to\r\nhis son's temperament, are unsuited to his. He wants to wear out rather\r\nthan to rust out.

He lacks nature's inward quietude.\r\nCalmness and peace come by being self-contained.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Weary of myself, and sick of asking\r\n  What I am, and what I ought to be,\r\n  At this vessel's prow I stand, which bears me\r\n  Forwards, forwards, o'er the starlit sea.\r\n\r\n  And a look of passionate desire\r\n  O'er the sea and to the stars I send:\r\n  \"Ye who from my childhood up have calmed me,\r\n  Calm me, ah, compose me to the end!\r\n\r\n  \"Ah, once more,\" I cried, \"ye stars, ye waters,\r\n  On my heart your mighty charm renew;\r\n  Still, still let me, as I gaze upon you,\r\n  Feel my soul becoming vast like you!\"\r\n\r\n  From the intense, clear, star-sown vault of heaven,\r\n  Over the lit sea's unquiet way,\r\n  In the rustling night-air came the answer:\r\n  \"Wouldst thou BE as these are?

In these stanzas he\r\nmakes the most of his gloomy situation and sings the joys of various\r\nkinds of freedom. First is the freedom brought by love, when his\r\nsweetheart speaks to him through the grate of the dungeon. Second is the\r\nfreedom brought by the recollection of good fellowship, when tried and\r\ntrue comrades took their wine straight--\"with no allaying Thames.\" Third\r\nis the freedom brought by remembrance of the king for whom he was\r\nsuffering. Finally comes the passionate and heroic assertion that though\r\nthe body of a man may be confined, nevertheless his spirit can remain\r\nfree and chainless.\r\n\r\n\r\n  When Love with unconfin\u00e9d wings\r\n    Hovers within my gates,\r\n  And my divine Althea brings\r\n    To whisper at the grates;\r\n  When I lie tangled in her hair\r\n    And fetter'd to her eye,\r\n  The Gods that wanton in the air\r\n    Know no such liberty.\r\n\r\n  When flowing cups run swiftly round\r\n    With no allaying Thames,\r\n  Our careless heads with roses bound,\r\n    Our hearts with loyal flames;\r\n  When thirsty grief in wine we steep,\r\n    When healths and draughts go free--\r\n  Fishes that tipple in the deep\r\n    Know no such liberty.\r\n\r\n  When (like committed linnets) I\r\n    With shriller throat shall sing\r\n  The sweetness, mercy, majesty\r\n    And glories of my King;\r\n  When I shall voice aloud how good\r\n    He is, how great should be,\r\n  Enlarged winds, that curl the flood,\r\n    Know no such liberty.\r\n\r\n  Stone walls do not a prison make,\r\n    Nor iron bars a cage;\r\n  Minds innocent and quiet take\r\n    That for an hermitage;\r\n  If I have freedom in my love\r\n    And in my soul am free,\r\n  Angels alone, that soar above,\r\n    Enjoy such liberty.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Richard Lovelace._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGRIEF\r\n\r\n\r\nShakespeare says: \"I can easier teach twenty what were good to be done,\r\nthan be one of the twenty to follow mine own teaching.\" This is\r\nespecially true regarding grief or affliction. \"Man was born unto\r\ntrouble, as the sparks fly upward,\" but we bid other people bear their\r\nsorrows manfully;

it dispels our worries and our\r\nfears; it allays the grief that seemed too poignant to be borne.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Yes, things are more or less amiss;\r\n  To-day it's that, to-morrow this;\r\n  Yet with so much that's out of whack,\r\n  Life does not wholly jump the track\r\n  Because, since matters move along,\r\n  No _one_ thing's always _staying_ wrong.\r\n  So heed not failures, losses, fears,\r\n  But trust the rectifying years.\r\n\r\n  What we shall have's not what we've got;\r\n  Our pains don't linger in one spot--\r\n  They skip about; the seesaw's end\r\n  That's up will mighty soon descend;\r\n  You've looked at bacon? Life's like that--\r\n  A streak of lean, a streak of fat.\r\n  Change, like a sky that clouds, that clears,\r\n  Hangs o'er the rectifying years.\r\n\r\n  Uneven things not leveled down\r\n  Are somehow simply got aroun';\r\n  The sting is taken from offence;\r\n  The evil has its recompense;\r\n  The broken heart is knit again;\r\n  The baffled longing knows not pain;\r\n  Wrong fades and trouble disappears\r\n  Before the rectifying years.\r\n\r\n  Then envy, hate towards man or class\r\n  Should from your sinful nature pass.\r\n  Though others hold a higher place\r\n  Or have more power or wealth or grace,\r\n  The best of them, be sure, cannot\r\n  Escape the common human lot;\r\n  So many smiles, so many tears\r\n  Come with the rectifying years.\r\n\r\n\r\n_St. Clair Adams._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THOSE WHO FAIL\r\n\r\n\r\nWe too often praise the man who wins just because he wins; the plaudits\r\nand laurels of victory are the unthinking crowd's means of estimating\r\nsuccess. But the vanquished may have fought more nobly than the victor;\r\nhe may have done his best against hopeless odds. As Addison makes Cato\r\nsay,\r\n\r\n  \"'Tis not in mortals to command success,\r\n  But we'll do more, Sempronius,--we'll deserve it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"All honor to him who shall win the prize,\"\r\n  The world has cried for a thousand years;\r\n  But to him who tries, and who fails and dies,\r\n  I give great honor and glory and tears;\r\n\r\n    Give glory and honor and pitiful tears\r\n  To all who fail in their deeds sublime;\r\n  Their ghosts are many in the van of years,\r\n  They were born with Time, in advance of Time.\r\n\r\n    Oh, great is the hero who wins a name,\r\n  But greater many and many a time\r\n  Some pale-faced fellow who dies in shame,\r\n  And lets God finish the thoughts sublime.\r\n\r\n    And great is the man with a sword undrawn,\r\n  And good is the man who refrains from wine;\r\n  But the man who fails and yet still fights on,\r\n  Lo, he is the twin-born brother of mine.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Joaquin Miller._\r\n\r\nFrom \"Joaquin Miller's Complete Poems.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHELPING' OUT\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I always look out for Number One,\" was the favorite remark of a man who\r\nthought he had found the great rule to success, but he had only stated\r\nhis own doctrine of selfishness, and his life was never very successful.\r\nA man must be big to succeed, and selfishness is always cramping and\r\nnarrow.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Da's a lot of

To kill time they went to work again,\r\nobserved, dissected, conjectured, and when at the end of a fortnight\r\nAgassiz finally appeared, they felt that their knowledge was really\r\nexhaustive. The master's brief comment was that they had made a fair\r\nbeginning, and again he left. They then fell to in earnest and after\r\nweeks and months of investigation declared that a fish was the most\r\nfascinating of studies.

To the terrors of an\r\nunknown sea and the mutinous dismay of the sailors Columbus has but two\r\nthings to oppose--his faith and his unflinching will. But these suffice,\r\nas they always do. In the last four lines of the poem is a lesson for\r\nour nation to-day. The seas upon which our ideals have launched us are\r\nperilous and uncharted.

Then spake the mate:\r\n  \"This mad sea shows his teeth to-night.\r\n  He curls his lip, he lies in wait,\r\n  With lifted teeth, as if to bite!\r\n  Brave Adm'r'l, say but one good word:\r\n  What shall we do when hope is gone?\"\r\n  The words leapt like a leaping sword:\r\n  \"Sail on! sail on! sail on! and on!\"\r\n\r\n  Then, pale and worn, he kept his deck,\r\n  And peered through darkness.

But Longfellow\r\ntells us this view is all wrong. The past can take care of itself, and\r\nwe need not even worry very much about the future; but if we are true to\r\nour own natures, we must be up and doing in the present.

The frog that kept leaping in\r\nbrave but seemingly hopeless endeavor at last churned the milk, mounted\r\nthe butter for a final effort, and escaped.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Submission? They have preached at that so long.\r\n  As though the head bowed down would right the wrong,\r\n    As though the folded hand, the coward heart\r\n  Were saintly signs of souls sublimely strong;\r\n    As though the man who acts the waiting part\r\n    And but submits, had little wings a-start.\r\n  But may I never reach that anguished plight\r\n  Where I at last grow weary of the fight.\r\n\r\n  Submission: \"Wrong of course must ever be\r\n  Because it ever was. 'Tis not for me\r\n    To seek a change; to strike the maiden blow.\r\n  'Tis best to bow the head and not to see;\r\n    'Tis best to dream, that we need never know\r\n    The truth. To turn our eyes away from woe.\"\r\n  Perhaps. But ah--I pray for keener sight,\r\n  And may I not grow weary of the fight.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Miriam Teichner._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA PRAYER\r\n\r\n\r\nGaribaldi, the Italian patriot, said to his men: \"I do not promise you\r\nease; I do not promise you comfort.

He does not ask for an easy death;\r\nhe does not wish to creep past an experience which all men sooner or\r\nlater must face, and which many men have faced so heroically. He has\r\nfought well in life; he wishes to make the last fight too. The poem was\r\nwritten shortly after the death of Mrs. Browning, and the closing lines\r\nrefer to her.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Fear death?--to feel the fog in my throat,\r\n    The mist in my face,\r\n  When the snows begin, and the blasts denote\r\n    I am nearing the place,\r\n  The power of the night, the press of the storm,\r\n    The post of the foe;\r\n  Where he stands, the Arch Fear in a visible form,\r\n    Yet the strong man must go:\r\n  For the journey is done and the summit attained,\r\n    And the barriers fall,\r\n  Though a battle's to fight ere the guerdon be gained,\r\n    The reward of it all.\r\n  I was ever a fighter, so--one fight more,\r\n    The best and the last!\r\n  I would hate that death bandaged my eyes, and forbore.\r\n    And bade me creep past.\r\n  No! let me taste the whole of it, fare like my peers\r\n    The heroes of old,\r\n  Bear the brunt, in a minute pay glad life's arrears\r\n    Of pain, darkness and cold.\r\n  For sudden the worst turns the best to the brave,\r\n    The black minute's at end,\r\n  And the elements' rage, the fiend-voices that rave,\r\n    Shall dwindle, shall blend,\r\n  Shall change, shall become first a peace out of pain,\r\n    Then a light, then thy breast,\r\n  O thou soul of my soul!

Many a man falls into absurdities and\r\nmistakes because he cannot get outside of himself and look at himself\r\nfrom other people's eyes.

In the\r\nend Prometheus wins a complete outward victory. Better still, by his\r\nsteadfastness and high purpose he has won a great inward triumph. The\r\nspirit that has actuated him and the nature of his achievement are\r\nexpressed in the following lines.\r\n\r\n\r\n  To suffer woes which Hope thinks infinite;\r\n  To forgive wrongs darker than death or night;\r\n    To defy Power, which seems omnipotent;\r\n  To love, and bear; to hope till Hope creates\r\n  From its own wreck the thing it contemplates;\r\n    Neither to change, nor falter, nor repent;\r\n  This, like thy glory, Titan, is to be\r\n  Good, great and joyous, beautiful and free;\r\n  This is alone Life, Joy, Empire, and Victory.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Percy Bysshe Shelley._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVICTORY IN DEFEAT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great, radiant souls of earth--the Davids, the Shakespeares, the\r\nLincolns--know grief and affliction as well as joy and triumph. But\r\nadversity is never to them mere adversity; it\r\n\r\n  \"Doth suffer a sea-change\r\n  Into something rich and strange\";\r\n\r\nand in the crucible of character their suffering itself is transmuted\r\ninto song.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Defeat may serve as well as victory\r\n  To shake the soul and let the glory out.\r\n  When the great oak is straining in the wind,\r\n  The boughs drink in new beauty, and the trunk\r\n  Sends down a deeper root on the windward side.\r\n  Only the soul that knows the mighty grief\r\n  Can know the mighty rapture. Sorrows come\r\n  To stretch out spaces in the heart for joy.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Edwin Markham._\r\n\r\nFrom \"The Shoes of Happiness, and Other Poems.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RICHER", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 272171, "end_char_idx": 276143, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, {"__data__": {"id_": "cabe3119-095e-47d8-8345-35c2b4ea3dab", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "../02_Fundamental_Concepts_in_LlamaIndex/data/pg10763.txt", "file_name": "pg10763.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 405245, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-05"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "../02_Fundamental_Concepts_in_LlamaIndex/data/pg10763.txt", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "../02_Fundamental_Concepts_in_LlamaIndex/data/pg10763.txt", "file_name": "pg10763.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 405245, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-05"}, "hash": "7ed8c6d21497c7614e40a55a120dca129c90f1a385c21a5c9e8c1c26e753f43d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "34ce1c62-d325-4ee7-b33c-2160f6b4b7be", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "../02_Fundamental_Concepts_in_LlamaIndex/data/pg10763.txt", "file_name": "pg10763.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 405245, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-05"}, "hash": "1d3adc6dc91b395bde0545878ff0ca3f8f073ba79658531f47e25d129e94029c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "44f18470-5e58-4fe5-8ff1-60e43cfdac85", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "552ba272fd2b772b9d10a2fb2edfe601c591a1a4efaf9001a8dee8ea73bb790c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Shoes of Happiness, and Other Poems.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RICHER MINES\r\n\r\n\r\nNo man is so poor but that he is a stockholder.

Stanton._\r\n\r\nFrom \"The Atlanta Constitution.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nODE TO DUTY\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the first stanza the poet hails duty as coming from God. It is a\r\nlight to guide us and a rod to check. To obey it does not lead to\r\nvictory; to obey it _is_ victory--is to live by a high, noble law. In\r\nthe second stanza he admits that some people do right without driving\r\nthemselves to it--do it by instinct and \"the genial sense of youth.\" In\r\nstanza 3 he looks forward to a time when all people will be thus\r\nblessed, but he thinks that as yet it is unsafe for most of us to lose\r\ntouch completely with stern, commanding duty. In stanzas 4 and 5 he\r\nstates that he himself has been too impatient of control, has wearied\r\nhimself by changing from one desire to another, and now wishes to\r\nregulate his life by some great abiding principle.

The sun rises afresh each new day. Once a year the\r\nspringtime returns and \"God renews His ancient rapture.\" So it is with\r\nour joys. They do not stay by us constantly; they pass from us and are\r\ngone; but we need not trouble ourselves--they are sure to come back.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Shed no tear!

All of us find it in simply being alive. Life is the gift no\r\ncreature in his right mind would part with. As Milton asks,\r\n\r\n  \"For who would lose,\r\n  Though full of pain, this intellectual being,\r\n  These thoughts that wander through eternity,\r\n  To perish rather, swallowed up and lost\r\n  In the wide womb of uncreated night,\r\n  Devoid of sense and motion?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n  Praise the generous gods for giving\r\n    In a world of wrath and strife,\r\n  With a little time for living,\r\n    Unto all the joy of life.\r\n\r\n  At whatever source we drink it,\r\n    Art or love or faith or wine,\r\n  In whatever terms we think it,\r\n    It is common and divine.\r\n\r\n  Praise the high gods, for in giving\r\n    This to man, and this alone,\r\n  They have made his chance of living\r\n    Shine the equal of their own.\r\n\r\n\r\n_William Ernest Henley._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOWARDS\r\n\r\n\r\nWe might as well accept the inevitable as the inevitable. There is no\r\nescaping death or taxes.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Cowards die many times before their deaths:\r\n  The valiant never taste of death but once.\r\n  Of all the wonders that I yet have heard,\r\n  It seems to me most strange that men should fear;\r\n  Seeing that death, a necessary end,\r\n  Will come, when it will come.\r\n\r\n\r\n_William Shakespeare._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WORD\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Cumaean sibyl offered Tarquin the Proud nine books for what seemed\r\nan exorbitant sum. He refused. She burned three of the books, and placed\r\nthe same price on the six as on the original nine. Again he refused. She\r\nburned three more books, and offered the remainder for the sum she first\r\nnamed. This time Tarquin accepted. The books were found to contain\r\nprophecies and invaluable directions regarding Roman policy, but alas,\r\nthey were no longer complete. So it is with joy. To take it now is to\r\nget it in its entirety. To defer until some other occasion is to get\r\nless of it--at the same cost.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Today, whatever may annoy,\r\n  The word for it is Joy, just simple joy:\r\n  The joy of life;\r\n  The joy of children and of wife;\r\n  The joy of bright blue skies;\r\n  The joy of rain; the glad surprise\r\n  Of twinkling stars that shine at night;\r\n  The joy of winged things upon their flight;\r\n  The joy of noonday, and the tried,\r\n  True joyousness of eventide;\r\n  The joy of labor and of mirth;\r\n  The joy of air, and sea, and earth--\r\n  The countless joys that ever flow from Him\r\n  Whose vast beneficence doth dim\r\n  The lustrous light of day,\r\n  And lavish gifts divine upon our way.\r\n  Whatever there be of Sorrow\r\n  I'll put off till To-morrow,\r\n  And when To-morrow comes, why, then\r\n  'Twill be To-day, and Joy again!\r\n\r\n\r\n_John Kendrick", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 287076, "end_char_idx": 290892, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, {"__data__": {"id_": "fabaf688-9b75-4f87-9bc3-d66ab4827bd4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "../02_Fundamental_Concepts_in_LlamaIndex/data/pg10763.txt", "file_name": "pg10763.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 405245, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-05"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "../02_Fundamental_Concepts_in_LlamaIndex/data/pg10763.txt", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "../02_Fundamental_Concepts_in_LlamaIndex/data/pg10763.txt", "file_name": "pg10763.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 405245, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-05"}, "hash": "7ed8c6d21497c7614e40a55a120dca129c90f1a385c21a5c9e8c1c26e753f43d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "51b664d7-a495-49c7-b777-9fbed5b4d636", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "../02_Fundamental_Concepts_in_LlamaIndex/data/pg10763.txt", "file_name": "pg10763.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 405245, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-05"}, "hash": "91a1dc8a6986b36b1cfeb6112f563b2c733d45b1f6e82db60ebc671ab35606b8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "70f09472-26cf-43df-b5a5-a412058a2fc6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "61aa81b8c7625afa38e672b2f522deaf8f34c9cbfeb6c6658085ec3e323e58a7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "'Twill be To-day, and Joy again!\r\n\r\n\r\n_John Kendrick Bangs._\r\n\r\nFrom \"The Atlantic Monthly.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nENVOI\r\n\r\n\r\nFranklin K.

Youth is wiser; it believes\r\nnothing impossible. Age conserves more; youth accomplishes more.

In the\r\nCivil War it was found that Lee's army could not be overwhelmed in a\r\nsingle battle, but one Federal general perceived that it could be worn\r\ndown by time and the pressure of numbers. \"I propose,\" said Grant, \"to\r\nfight it out on this line if it takes all summer.\" It took more than a\r\nsummer; it took nearly a year--but he did it. In the moral realm\r\nlikewise, \"All things excellent are as difficult as they are rare.\"\r\nCharacter is not attained over-night. The only way to develop moral\r\nmuscles is to exercise them patiently and long.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Heaven is not reached at a single bound;\r\n    But we build the ladder by which we rise\r\n    From the lowly earth to the vaulted skies,\r\n  And we mount to its summit, round by round.\r\n\r\n  I count this thing to be grandly true:\r\n    That a noble deed is a step towards God,--\r\n    Lifting the soul from the common clod\r\n  To a purer air and a broader view.\r\n\r\n  We rise by the things that are under feet;\r\n    By what we have mastered of good and gain;\r\n    By the pride deposed and the passion slain,\r\n  And the vanquished ills that we hourly meet.\r\n\r\n  We hope, we aspire, we resolve, we trust,\r\n    When the morning calls us to life and light,\r\n    But our hearts grow weary, and, ere the night,\r\n  Our lives are trailing the sordid dust.\r\n\r\n  We hope, we resolve, we aspire, we pray,\r\n    And we think that we mount the air on wings\r\n    Beyond the recall of sensual things,\r\n  While our feet still cling to the heavy clay.\r\n\r\n  Wings for the angels, but feet for men!\r\n    We may borrow the wings to find the way--\r\n    We may hope, and resolve, and aspire, and pray;\r\n  But our feet must rise, or we fall again.\r\n\r\n  Only in dreams is a ladder thrown\r\n    From the weary earth to the sapphire walls;\r\n    But the dreams depart, and the vision falls,\r\n  And the sleeper wakes on his pillow of stone.\r\n\r\n  Heaven is not reached at a single bound;\r\n    But we build the ladder by which we rise\r\n    From the lowly earth to the vaulted skies,\r\n  And we mount to its summit, round by round.\r\n\r\n\r\n_J.G.

The\r\nanswer here given by the poet is that so richly is man endowed with\r\nqualities and attributes that if contentment were added to them, he\r\nwould be satisfied with what he has, and would not strive for that which\r\nis higher still--the fulfilment of his spiritual cravings.\r\n\r\n\r\n    When God at first made Man,\r\n  Having a glass of blessings standing by;\r\n  Let us (said He) pour on him all we can:\r\n  Let the world's riches, which dispers\u00e9d lie,\r\n    Contract into a span.\r\n\r\n    So strength first made a way;\r\n  Then beauty flow'd, then wisdom, honor, pleasure\r\n  When almost all was out, God made a stay,\r\n  Perceiving that alone, of all His treasure,\r\n    Rest in the bottom lay.\r\n\r\n    For if I should (said He)\r\n  Bestow this jewel also on My creature,\r\n  He would adore My gifts instead of Me,\r\n  And rest in Nature, not the God of Nature.\r\n    So both should losers be.\r\n\r\n    Yet let him keep the rest,\r\n  But keep them with repining restlessness:\r\n  Let him be rich and weary, that at least,\r\n  If goodness lead him not, yet weariness\r\n    May toss him to My breast.\r\n\r\n\r\n_George Herbert._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA PHILOSOPHER\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The web of our life is of mingled yarn, good and ill together,\" says\r\nShakespeare.

First, commit something good to memory each day. Three or four\r\nwords will do, just a pretty bit of poem, or a Bible verse.

She gave the three rules--memorize something\r\ngood each day, see something beautiful each day, do something helpful\r\neach day. When the children reported at the end of the week, not a\r\nsingle day had any of them lost. But hard put to it to obey her? Indeed\r\nthey had been.

Salarino tells him that the mental attitude is\r\neverything; that mirth is as easy as gloom; that nature in her\r\nfreakishness makes some men laugh at trifles until their eyes become\r\nmere slits, yet leaves others dour and unsmiling before jests that would\r\nconvulse even the venerable Nestor. Gratiano maintains that Antonio is\r\ntoo absorbed in worldly affairs, and that he must not let his spirits\r\ngrow sluggish or irritable.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _ANT._     In sooth, I know not why I am so sad:\r\n  It wearies me; you say it wearies you;\r\n  But how I caught it, found it, or came by it,\r\n  What stuff 'tis made of, whereof it is born,\r\n  I am to learn.\r\n\r\n  _Salar_.     Then let's say you are sad\r\n  Because you are not merry: and 'twere as easy\r\n  For you to laugh and leap, and say you are merry,\r\n  Because you are not sad. Now, by two-headed Janus,\r\n  Nature hath framed strange fellows in her time:\r\n  Some that will evermore peep through their eyes\r\n  And laugh like parrots at a bag-piper,\r\n  And other of such vinegar aspect\r\n  That they'll not show their teeth in way of smile,\r\n  Though Nestor swear the jest be laughable.\r\n\r\n  _Gra_.    You look not well, Signior Antonio;\r\n  You have too much respect upon the world:\r\n  They lose it that do buy it with much care:\r\n  Believe me, you are marvelously changed.\r\n\r\n  _Ant_.

Most of us have something that we\r\nlike to do more than anything else. We are not free to do it as we wish.\r\nWe are handicapped by the need to earn a living, by physical weariness,\r\nby the carpings and scoffs of the envious, by the limited time we have\r\nat our disposal. But underneath all this is _the spirit of work_--the\r\ndesire to take up our task for its own sake alone, to give our whole\r\nselves to it, to carry it through, not in some partial way, but in\r\naccordance with the fulness of our dream. We want to be free from\r\ndistractions and interruptions; if we are driven at all, we want it to\r\nbe by our own inner promptings, not by obligation or necessity. Of\r\ncourse these favorable, these ideal conditions belong to heaven, not to\r\nearth. Kipling here explains what they will mean to the artist, the\r\npainter; but in doing so he expresses the longings of the true workman\r\nof whatsoever sort--he sums up the true spirit of work.\r\n\r\n\r\n  When Earth's last picture is painted and the tubes are twisted and dried,\r\n  When the oldest colors have faded, and the youngest critic has died,\r\n  We shall rest, and, faith, we shall need it--lie down for an aeon or two,\r\n  Till the Master of All Good Workmen shall set us to work anew.\r\n\r\n  And those that were good will be happy: they shall sit in a golden chair;\r\n  They shall splash at a ten-league canvas with brushes of comets' hair.\r\n  They shall find real saints to draw from--Magdalene, Peter, and Paul;\r\n  They shall work for an age at a sitting and never be tired at", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 332033, "end_char_idx": 335733, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, {"__data__": {"id_": "6e643919-f350-4854-b34e-0b71a2893af6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "../02_Fundamental_Concepts_in_LlamaIndex/data/pg10763.txt", "file_name": "pg10763.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 405245, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-05"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "../02_Fundamental_Concepts_in_LlamaIndex/data/pg10763.txt", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "../02_Fundamental_Concepts_in_LlamaIndex/data/pg10763.txt", "file_name": "pg10763.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 405245, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-05"}, "hash": "7ed8c6d21497c7614e40a55a120dca129c90f1a385c21a5c9e8c1c26e753f43d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "63f9c30a-1266-42e3-b47b-57a1ebe326c4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "../02_Fundamental_Concepts_in_LlamaIndex/data/pg10763.txt", "file_name": "pg10763.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 405245, "creation_date": "2025-02-02", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-05"}, "hash": "62bc61551df447b620615a6e9a862b67b44e96e21cbb44c9c1f3f97efb01d392", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "80d2147e-fa52-445c-a39d-26f6d7eb6960", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "013302eb1dcab0195efd0ef7467d6ca25328b90a0941a8827b0f6e5accb537fa", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "They shall work for an age at a sitting and never be tired at all!\r\n\r\n  And only the Master shall praise us, and only the Master shall blame;\r\n  And no one shall work for money, and no one shall work for fame,\r\n  But each for the joy of the working, and each, in his separate star,\r\n  Shall draw the Thing as he sees It for the God of Things as They are!\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rudyard Kipling._\r\n\r\nFrom \"Rudyard Kipling's Verse, 1885-1918.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX BY AUTHORS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA\r\n\r\nADAMS, ST.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg\u2122\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\u2122\u2019s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\u2122 collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg\u2122 and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\u2019s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\u2019s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\u2019s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nSection 5.

CLAIR ADAMS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOREWORD\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a volume of inspirational poems. Its purpose is to bring men\r\ncourage and resolution, to cheer them, to fire them with new confidence\r\nwhen they grow dispirited, to strengthen their faith that THINGS CAN BE\r\nDONE. It is better for this purpose than the entire works of any one\r\npoet, for it takes the cream of many and has greater diversity than any\r\none writer can show.\r\n\r\nIt is made up chiefly of very recent poems--not such as were written for\r\nanthologies of poetical \"gems,\" but such as speak directly to the heart,\r\nalways in very simple language, often in the phrases of shop or office\r\nor street. Included, however, with the poems of the day are a few of the\r\nfine old pieces that have been of comfort to men through the ages.\r\n\r\nBesides the poems themselves, the volume contains helps to their\r\nunderstanding and enjoyment. The pieces are introduced by short\r\ncomments; these serve the same purpose as the strain played by the\r\npianist before the singer begins to sing; they create a mood, give a\r\npoint of view, throw light on the meaning of what follows. Also the\r\nlives of the authors are briefly summarized; this is in answer to our\r\nnatural interest in the writer of a poem we like, and in the case of\r\nliving poets it brings together facts hardly to be found anywhere else.\r\n\r\nFinally, the book is not one to be read and then cast aside. It is to be\r\nkept as a constant companion and an unfailing recourse in weariness or\r\ngloom. Human companions are not always in the mood to cheer us, and may\r\ntalk upon themes we dislike. But this book will converse or be silent,\r\nit is never out of sorts or discouraged, and so far from being wed to\r\nsome single topic, it will speak to us at any time on any subject we\r\ndesire.\r\n\r\nTo many authors and publishers acknowledgment is due for generous\r\npermission to use copyright material.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nAbou Ben Adhem............................. _Leigh Hunt_\r\nAnswer, The................................ _Grantland Rice_\r\nAppreciation............................... _William Judson Kibby_\r\nArrow and the Song, The.................... _Henry Wadsworth Longfellow_\r\nAwareness.................................. _Miriam Teichner_\r\n\r\nBars of Fate, The.......................... _Ellen M.H.

Yet success is not occupying a lofty place\r\nor doing conspicuous work; it is being the best that is in you. Rattling\r\naround in too big a job is much worse than filling a small one to\r\noverflowing. Dream, aspire by all means; but do not ruin the life you\r\nmust lead by dreaming pipe-dreams of the one you would like to lead.\r\nMake the most of what you have and are. Perhaps your trivial, immediate\r\ntask is your one sure way of proving your mettle. Do the thing near at\r\nhand, and great things will come to your hand to be done.\r\n\r\n\r\n  If you can't be a pine on the top of the hill\r\n    Be a scrub in the valley--but be\r\n  The best little scrub by the side of the rill;\r\n    Be a bush if you can't be a tree.\r\n\r\n  If you can't be a bush be a bit of the grass,\r\n    And some highway some happier make;\r\n  If you can't be a muskie then just be a bass--\r\n    But the liveliest bass in the lake!\r\n\r\n  We can't all be captains, we've got to be crew,\r\n    There's something for all of us here.\r\n  There's big work to do and there's lesser to do,\r\n    And the task we must do is the near.\r\n\r\n  If you can't be a highway then just be a trail,\r\n    If you can't be the sun be a star;\r\n  It isn't by size that you win or you fail--\r\n    Be the best of whatever you are!\r\n\r\n\r\n_Douglas Malloch._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HOUSE BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD\r\n\r\n\r\nThis poem has as its keynote friendship and sympathy for other people.\r\nIt is a paradox of life that by hoarding love and happiness", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 15215, "end_char_idx": 19893, "text_template":

more we share, the more we possess. We of course find in other\r\npeople weaknesses and sins, but our best means of curing these are\r\nthrough a wise and sympathetic understanding.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Let me live in a house by the side of the road,\r\n    Where the race of men go by--\r\n  The men who are good and the men who are bad,\r\n    As good and as bad as I.\r\n  I would not sit in the scorner's seat,\r\n    Or hurl the cynic's ban;--\r\n  Let me live in a house by the side of the road\r\n    And be a friend to man.\r\n\r\n  I see from my house by the side of the road,\r\n    By the side of the highway of life,\r\n  The men who press with the ardor of hope,\r\n    The men who are faint with the strife.\r\n  But I turn not away from their smiles nor their tears--\r\n    Both parts of an infinite plan;--\r\n  Let me live in my house by the side of the road\r\n    And be a friend to man.\r\n\r\n  I know there are brook-gladdened meadows ahead\r\n    And mountains of wearisome height;\r\n  And the road passes on through the long afternoon\r\n    And stretches away to the night.\r\n  But still I rejoice when the travelers rejoice,\r\n    And weep with the strangers that moan,\r\n  Nor live in my house by the side of the road\r\n    Like a man who dwells alone.\r\n\r\n  Let me live in my house by the side of the road\r\n    Where the race of men go by--\r\n  They are good, they are bad, they are weak, they are strong,\r\n    Wise, foolish--so am I.\r\n  Then why should I sit in the scorner's seat\r\n    Or hurl the cynic's ban?--\r\n  Let me live in my house by the side of the road\r\n    And be a friend to man.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sam Walter Foss._\r\n\r\nFrom \"Dreams in Homespun.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOUR THINGS\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are the qualities of ideal manhood? Various people have given\r\nvarious answers to this question. Here the poet states what qualities he\r\nthinks indispensable.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Four things a man must learn to do\r\n  If he would make his record true:\r\n  To think without confusion clearly;\r\n  To love his fellow-men sincerely;\r\n  To act from honest motives purely;\r\n  To trust in God and Heaven securely.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Henry Van Dyke._\r\n\r\nFrom \"Collected Poems.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIF\r\n\r\n\r\nThe central idea of this poem is that success comes from self-control\r\nand a true sense of the values of things. In extremes lies danger. A man\r\nmust not lose heart because of doubts or opposition, yet he must do his\r\nbest to see the grounds for both. He must not be deceived into thinking\r\neither triumph or disaster final; he must use each wisely--and push on.\r\nIn all things he must hold to the golden mean. If he does, he will own\r\nthe world, and even better, for his personal reward he will attain the\r\nfull stature of manhood.\r\n\r\n\r\n  If you can keep your head when all about you\r\n    Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,\r\n  If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,\r\n    But make allowance for their doubting too;\r\n  If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,\r\n    Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,\r\n  Or being hated don't give way to hating,\r\n    And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:\r\n\r\n  If you can dream--and not make dreams your master;\r\n    If you can think--and not make thoughts your aim,\r\n  If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster\r\n    And treat those two imposters just the same;\r\n  If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken\r\n    Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,\r\n  Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,\r\n    And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:\r\n\r\n  If you can make one heap of all your winnings\r\n    And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,\r\n  And lose, and start again at your beginnings\r\n    And never breathe a word about your loss;\r\n  If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew\r\n    To serve your turn long after they are gone,\r\n  And so", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 19819, "end_char_idx": 23722, "text_template":

of\r\ncourage undismayed. It rings with the power of the individual to guide\r\nhis own destiny.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Out of the night that covers me,\r\n    Black as the Pit from pole to pole,\r\n  I thank whatever gods may be\r\n    For my unconquerable soul.\r\n\r\n  In the fell clutch of circumstance\r\n    I have not winced nor cried aloud.\r\n  Under the bludgeonings of chance\r\n    My head is bloody, but unbowed.\r\n\r\n  Beyond this place of wrath and tears\r\n    Looms but the Horror of the shade,\r\n  And yet the menace of the years\r\n    Finds, and shall find, me unafraid.\r\n\r\n  It matters not how strait the gate,\r\n    How charged with punishments the scroll,\r\n  I am the master of my fate:\r\n    I am the captain of my soul.\r\n\r\n\r\n_William Ernest Henley._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIT COULDN'T BE DONE\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter a thing has been done, everybody is ready to declare it easy. But\r\nbefore it has been done, it is called impossible. One reason why people\r\nfear to embark upon great enterprises is that they see all the\r\ndifficulties at once. They know they could succeed in the initial tasks,\r\nbut they shrink from what is to follow. Yet \"a thing begun is half\r\ndone.\" Moreover the surmounting of the first barrier gives strength and\r\ningenuity for the harder ones beyond. Mountains viewed from a distance\r\nseem to be unscalable. But they can be climbed, and the way to begin is\r\nto take the first upward step. From that moment the mountains are less\r\nhigh. As Hannibal led his army across the foothills, then among the\r\nupper ranges, and finally over the loftiest peaks and passes of the\r\nAlps, or as Peary pushed farther and farther into the solitudes that\r\nencompass the North Pole, so can you achieve any purpose whatsoever if\r\nyou heed not the doubters, meet each problem as it arises, and keep ever\r\nwith you the assurance _It Can Be Done_.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Somebody said that it couldn't be done,\r\n    But he with a chuckle replied\r\n  That \"maybe it couldn't,\" but he would be one\r\n    Who wouldn't say so till he'd tried.\r\n  So he buckled right in with the trace of a grin\r\n    On his face. If he worried he hid it.\r\n  He started to sing as he tackled the thing\r\n    That couldn't be done, and he did it.\r\n\r\n  Somebody scoffed: \"Oh, you'll never do that;\r\n    At least no one ever has done it\";\r\n  But he took off his coat and he took off his hat,\r\n    And the first thing we knew he'd begun it.\r\n  With a lift of his chin and a bit of a grin,\r\n    Without any doubting or quiddit,\r\n  He started to sing as he tackled the thing\r\n    That couldn't be done, and he did it.\r\n\r\n  There are thousands to tell you it cannot be done,\r\n    There are thousands to prophesy failure;\r\n  There are thousands to point out to you one by one,\r\n    The dangers that wait to assail you.\r\n  But just buckle in with a bit of a grin,\r\n    Just take off your coat and go to it;\r\n  Just start to sing as you tackle the thing\r\n    That \"cannot be done,\" and you'll do it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Edgar A.

gets the glad hand in the populous\r\n  town, or out where the farmers make hay; he's greeted with\r\n  pleasure on deserts of sand, and deep in the aisles of the\r\n  woods; wherever he goes there's the welcoming hand--he's The\r\n  Man Who Delivers the Goods. The failures of life sit around and\r\n  complain; the gods haven't treated them white; they've lost\r\n  their umbrellas whenever there's rain, and they haven't their\r\n  lanterns at night; men tire of the failures who fill with their\r\n  sighs the air of their own neighborhoods; there's one who is\r\n  greeted with love-lighted eyes--he's The Man Who Delivers the\r\n  Goods. One fellow is lazy, and watches the clock, and waits for\r\n  the whistle to blow; and one has a hammer, with which he will\r\n  knock, and one tells a story of woe; and one, if requested to\r\n  travel a mile, will measure the perches and roods; but one does\r\n  his stunt with a whistle or smile--he's The Man Who Delivers\r\n  the Goods. One man is afraid that he'll labor too hard--the\r\n  world isn't yearning for such; and one man is always alert, on\r\n  his guard, lest he put in a minute too much; and one has a\r\n  grouch or a temper that's bad, and one is a creature of moods;\r\n  so it's hey for the joyous and rollicking lad--for the One Who\r\n  Delivers the Goods!\r\n\r\n\r\n_Walt Mason._\r\n\r\nFrom \"Walt Mason, His Book.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE QUITTER\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the famous naval duel between the _Bonhomme Richard_ and the\r\n_Serapis_, John Paul Jones was hailed by his adversary to know whether\r\nhe struck his colors. \"I have not yet begun to fight,\" was his answer.\r\nWhen the surrender took place, it was not Jones's ship that became the\r\nprize of war. Everybody admires a hard fighter--the man who takes\r\nbuffets standing up, and in a spirit of \"Never say die\" is always ready\r\nfor more.\r\n\r\n\r\n  When you're lost in the wild and you're scared as a child,\r\n    And death looks you bang in the eye;\r\n  And you're sore as a boil, it's according to Hoyle\r\n    To cock your revolver and die.\r\n  But the code of a man says fight all you can,\r\n    And self-dissolution is barred;\r\n  In hunger and woe, oh it's easy to blow--\r\n    It's the hell served for breakfast that's hard.\r\n\r\n  You're sick of the game? Well now, that's a shame!\r\n    You're young and you're brave and you're bright.\r\n  You've had a raw deal, I know, but don't squeal.\r\n    Buck up, do your damnedest and fight!\r\n  It's the plugging away that will win you the day,\r\n    So don't be a piker, old pard;\r\n  Just draw on your grit; it's so easy to quit--\r\n    It's the keeping your chin up that's hard.\r\n\r\n  It's easy to cry that you're beaten and die,\r\n    It's easy to crawfish and crawl,\r\n  But to fight and to fight when hope's out of sight,\r\n    Why, that's the best game of them all.\r\n  And though you come out of each grueling bout,\r\n    All broken and beaten and scarred--\r\n  Just have one more try. It's dead easy to die,\r\n    It's the keeping on living that's hard.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Robert W.

Often a woman is responsible for\r\nevents by whose crash and splendor she herself is obscured. Often too\r\nshe shapes the career of husband or brother or son. A man succeeds and\r\nreaps the honors of public applause, when in truth a quiet little woman\r\nhas made it all possible--has by her tact and encouragement held him to\r\nhis best, has had faith in him when his own faith has languished, has\r\ncheered him with the unfailing assurance, \"You can, you must, you will.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Somewhere she waits to make you win, your soul in her firm, white hands--\r\nSomewhere the gods have made for you, the Woman Who Understands!_\r\n\r\n  As the tide went out she found him\r\n    Lashed to a spar of Despair,\r\n  The wreck of his Ship around him--\r\n    The wreck of his Dreams in the air;\r\n  Found him and loved him and gathered\r\n    The soul of him close to her heart--\r\n  The soul that had sailed an uncharted sea,\r\n  The soul that had sought to win and be free--\r\n    The soul of which _she_ was part!\r\n      And there in the dusk she cried to the man,\r\n      \"Win your battle--you can, you can!\"\r\n\r\n  Broken by Fate, unrelenting,\r\n    Scarred by the lashings of Chance;\r\n  Bitter his heart--unrepenting--\r\n    Hardened by Circumstance;\r\n  Shadowed by Failure ever,\r\n    Cursing, he would have died,\r\n  But the touch of her hand, her strong warm hand,\r\n  And her love of his soul, took full command,\r\n    Just at the turn of the tide!\r\n      Standing beside him, filled with trust,\r\n      \"Win!\" she whispered, \"you must, you must!\"\r\n\r\n  Helping and loving and guiding,\r\n    Urging when that were best,\r\n  Holding her fears in hiding\r\n    Deep in her quiet breast;\r\n  This is the woman who kept him\r\n    True to his standards lost,\r\n  When, tossed in the storm and stress of strife,\r\n  He thought himself through with the game of life\r\n    And ready to pay the cost.\r\n      Watching and guarding, whispering still,\r\n      \"Win you can--and you will, you will!\"\r\n\r\n  This is the story of ages,\r\n    This is the Woman's way;\r\n  Wiser than seers or sages,\r\n    Lifting us day by day;\r\n  Facing all things with a courage\r\n    Nothing can daunt or dim,\r\n  Treading Life's path, wherever it leads--\r\n  Lined with flowers or choked with weeds,\r\n    But ever with him--with him!\r\n      Guidon--comrade--golden spur--\r\n      The men who win are helped by _her_!\r\n\r\n_Somewhere she waits, strong in belief, your soul in her firm, white hands:\r\nThank well the gods, when she comes to you--the Woman Who Understands!_\r\n\r\n\r\n_Everard Jack Appleton._\r\n\r\nFrom \"The Quiet Courage.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWANTED--A MAN\r\n\r\n\r\nBusiness and the world are exacting in their demands upon us.

It is a debt of honor. If an accident should\r\nhappen to me, he has nothing to show.\" The tradesman tore his note to\r\npieces: \"I change my debt into a debt of honor.\" Fox thanked him and\r\nhanded over the money, saying that Sheridan's debt was not of so long\r\nstanding and that Sheridan must wait. But most of us know men who are\r\nless scrupulous than Fox.\r\n\r\n\r\n    If I should die to-night\r\n  And you should come to my cold corpse and say,\r\n  Weeping and heartsick o'er my lifeless clay--\r\n    If I should die to-night,\r\n  And you should come in deepest grief and woe--\r\n  And say: \"Here's that ten dollars that I owe,\"\r\n    I might arise in my large white cravat\r\n    And say, \"What's that?\"\r\n\r\n    If I should die to-night\r\n  And you should come to my cold corpse and kneel,\r\n  Clasping my bier to show the grief you feel,\r\n    I say, if I should die to-night\r\n  And you should come to me, and there and then\r\n    Just even hint 'bout payin' me that ten,\r\n    I might arise the while,\r\n    But I'd drop dead again.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ben King._\r\n\r\nFrom \"Ben King's Verse.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUST BE GLAD\r\n\r\n\r\nMisfortunes overtake us, difficulties confront us; but these things must\r\nnot induce us to give up.

Just be glad.\r\n\r\n\r\n_James Whitcomb Riley._\r\n\r\nFrom the Biographical Edition Of the\r\nComplete Works of James Whitcomb Riley.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOPPORTUNITY\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I lack only one of having a hundred,\" said a student after an\r\nexamination; \"I have the two naughts.\" And all he did lack was a one,\r\n_rightly placed_. The world is full of opportunities. Discernment to\r\nperceive, courage to undertake, patience to carry through, will change\r\nthe whole aspect of the universe for us and bring positive achievement\r\nout of meaningless negation.\r\n\r\n\r\n  With doubt and dismay you are smitten\r\n    You think there's no chance for you, son?\r\n  Why, the best books haven't been written\r\n    The best race hasn't been run,\r\n  The best score hasn't been made yet,\r\n    The best song hasn't been sung,\r\n  The best tune hasn't been played yet,\r\n    Cheer up, for the world is young!\r\n\r\n  No chance? Why the world is just eager\r\n    For things that you ought to create\r\n  Its store of true wealth is still meagre\r\n    Its needs are incessant and great,\r\n  It yearns for more power and beauty\r\n    More laughter and love and romance,\r\n  More loyalty, labor and duty,\r\n    No chance--why there's nothing but chance!\r\n\r\n  For the best verse hasn't been rhymed yet,\r\n    The best house hasn't been planned,\r\n  The highest peak hasn't been climbed yet,\r\n    The mightiest rivers aren't spanned,\r\n  Don't worry and fret, faint hearted,\r\n    The chances have just begun,\r\n  For the Best jobs haven't been started,\r\n    The Best work hasn't been done.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Berton Braley._\r\n\r\nFrom \"A Banjo at Armageddon.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLITUDE\r\n\r\n\r\nSaid an Irishman who had several times been kicked downstairs: \"I begin\r\nto think they don't want me around here.\" So it is with our sorrows, our\r\nstruggles. Life decrees that they belong to us individually. If we try\r\nto make others share them, we are shunned. But struggling and weary\r\nhumanity is glad enough to share our joys.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Laugh, and the world laughs with you;\r\n  Weep, and you weep alone;\r\n    For the sad old earth\r\n    Must borrow its mirth,\r\n  It has trouble enough of its own.\r\n\r\n  Sing, and the hills will answer;\r\n  Sigh, it is lost on the air;\r\n    The echoes bound\r\n    To a joyful sound,\r\n  But shrink from voicing care.\r\n\r\n  Rejoice, and men will seek you;\r\n  Grieve, and they turn and go;\r\n    They want full measure\r\n    Of all your pleasure,\r\n  But they do not want your woe.\r\n\r\n  Be glad, and your friends are many;\r\n  Be sad, and you lose them all;\r\n    There are none to decline\r\n    Your nectared wine,\r\n  But alone you must drink life's gall.\r\n\r\n  Feast, and your halls are crowded;\r\n  Fast, and the world goes by;\r\n    Succeed and give,\r\n    And it helps you live,\r\n  But it cannot help you die.\r\n\r\n  There is room in the halls of pleasure\r\n  For a long and lordly train;\r\n    But one by one\r\n    We must all file on\r\n  Through the narrow aisles of pain.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ella Wheeler Wilcox._\r\n\r\nFrom \"How Salvator Won.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNSUBDUED\r\n\r\n\r\n\"An artist's career,\" said Whistler, \"always begins to-morrow.\" So does\r\nthe career of any man of courage and imagination. The Eden of such a man\r\ndoes not lie in yesterday. If he has done well, he forgets his\r\nachievements and dreams of the big deeds ahead. If he has been thwarted,\r\nhe forgets his failures and looks forward to vast, sure successes. If\r\nfate itself opposes him, he defies it.

One of the vessels struck something, a\r\nterrific explosion followed, the vessel went down. \"Torpedoes,", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 38020, "end_char_idx": 41803, "text_template":

It gives an outlet\r\nfrom sorrow, restrains wild desires, ripens and refines character,\r\nenables human beings to cooperate with God, and when well done, brings\r\nto life its consummate satisfaction.

To cross on broken ice,\r\nas Eliza did to freedom, or to row amid floating ice, as Washington did\r\nto victory, is harder still. This poem applies especially to those who\r\nare discouraged in a struggle to which they are already committed.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Everything's easy after it's done;\r\n  Every battle's a \"cinch\" that's won;\r\n  Every problem is clear that's solved--\r\n  The earth was round when it _revolved!_\r\n  But Washington stood amid grave doubt\r\n  With enemy forces camped about;\r\n  He could not know how he would fare\r\n  Till _after_ he'd crossed the Delaware.\r\n\r\n  Though the river was full of ice\r\n  He did not think about it twice,\r\n  But started across in the dead of night,\r\n  The enemy waiting to open the fight.\r\n  Likely feeling pretty blue,\r\n  Being human, same as you,\r\n  But he was brave amid despair,\r\n  And Washington crossed the Delaware!\r\n\r\n  So when you're with trouble beset,\r\n  And your spirits are soaking wet,\r\n  When all the sky with clouds is black,\r\n  Don't lie down upon your back\r\n  And look at _them_. Just do the thing;\r\n  Though you are choked, still try to sing.\r\n  If times are dark, believe them fair,\r\n  And you will cross the Delaware!\r\n\r\n\r\n_Joseph Morris._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRABBI BEN EZRA\r\n\r\n(SELECTED VERSES)\r\n\r\n\r\nTo some people success is everything, and the easier it is gained the\r\nbetter. To Browning success is nothing unless it is won by painful\r\neffort. What Browning values is struggle. Throes, rebuffs, even failure\r\nto achieve what we wish, are to be welcomed, for the effects of vigorous\r\nendeavor inweave themselves into our characters; moreover through\r\nstruggle we lift ourselves from the degradation into which the indolent\r\nfall. In the intervals of strife we may look back dispassionately upon\r\nwhat we have gone through, see where we erred and where we did wisely,\r\nwatch the workings of universal laws, and resolve to apply hereafter\r\nwhat we have hitherto learned.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Then, welcome each rebuff\r\n  That turns earth's smoothness rough,\r\n  Each sting that bids nor sit nor stand but go!\r\n  Be our joys three-parts pain!\r\n  Strive, and hold cheap the strain;\r\n  Learn, nor account the pang; dare, never grudge the throe!\r\n\r\n  For thence,--a paradox\r\n  Which comforts while it mocks,--\r\n  Shall life succeed in that it seems to fail:\r\n  What I aspired to be,\r\n  And was not, comforts me:\r\n  A brute I might have been, but would not sink i' the scale.\r\n\r\n  So, still within this life,\r\n  Though lifted o'er its strife,\r\n  Let me discern, compare, pronounce at last,\r\n  \"This rage was right i' the main,\r\n  That acquiescence vain:\r\n  The Future I may face now I have

it.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Melancholy,\r\n  Melancholy,\r\n  I've no use for you, by Golly!\r\n  Yet I'm going to keep you hidden\r\n  In some chamber dark, forbidden,\r\n  Just as though you were a prize,

his\r\nironclads into Charleston harbor. \"You haven't given me the main reason\r\nyet,\" said Farragut. \"What's that?\" \"You didn't think you could do it.\"\r\nSo the man who thinks he can't pass a lion, can't. But the man who\r\nthinks he can, can. Indeed he oftentimes finds that the lion isn't\r\nreally there at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n  I dare not!--\r\n               Look! the road is very dark--\r\n  The trees stir softly and the bushes shake,\r\n  The long grass rustles, and the darkness moves\r\n  Here! there! beyond--!\r\n  There's something crept across the road just now!\r\n  And you would have me go--?\r\n  Go _there_, through that live darkness, hideous\r\n  With stir of crouching forms that wait to kill?\r\n  Ah, _look_! See there! and there! and there again!\r\n  Great yellow, glassy eyes, close to the ground!\r\n  Look! Now the clouds are lighter I can see\r\n  The long slow lashing of the sinewy tails,\r\n  And the set quiver of strong jaws that wait--!\r\n  Go there? Not I! Who dares to go who sees\r\n  So perfectly the lions in the path?\r\n\r\n  Comes one who dares.\r\n                       Afraid at first, yet bound\r\n  On such high errand as no fear could stay.\r\n  Forth goes he, with lions in his path.\r\n  And then--?\r\n              He dared a death of agony--\r\n  Outnumbered battle with the king of beasts--\r\n  Long struggles in the horror of the night--\r\n  Dared, and went forth to meet--O ye who fear!\r\n  Finding an empty road, and nothing there--\r\n  And fences, and the dusty roadside trees--\r\n  Some spitting kittens, maybe, in the grass.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Charlotte Perkins Gilman._\r\n\r\nFrom \"In This Our World.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ANSWER\r\n\r\n\r\nBob Fitzsimmons lacked the physical bulk of the men he fought, was\r\nungainly in build and movement, and not infrequently got himself floored\r\nin the early rounds of his contests. But many people consider him the\r\nbest fighter for his weight who ever stepped into the prize ring. Not a\r\nfavorite at first, he won the popular heart by making good. Of course he\r\nhad great natural powers; from any position when the chance at last came\r\nhe could dart forth a sudden, wicked blow that no human being could\r\nwithstand. But more formidable still was the spirit which gave him cool\r\nand complete command of all his resources, and made him most dangerous\r\nwhen he was on the verge of being knocked out.\r\n\r\n\r\n

swings at the ball till he swats it for four bases. Ty Cobb doesn't\r\ncomplain that whole teams work wits and muscles overtime to keep him\r\nfrom stealing home; he pits himself against them all and comes galloping\r\nor hurdling or sliding in. What other men can do any man can do if he\r\nworks long enough with a brave enough heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"The world is against me,\" he said with a sigh.\r\n  \"Somebody stops every scheme that I try.\r\n  The world has me down and it's keeping me there;\r\n  I don't get a chance.

Guest._\r\n\r\nFrom \"Just Folks.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSAY NOT THE STRUGGLE NOUGHT AVAILETH\r\n\r\n\r\nIn any large or prolonged enterprise we are likely to take too limited a\r\nview of the progress we are making. The obstacles do not yield at some\r\ngiven point; we therefore imagine we have made no headway. The poet here\r\nuses three comparisons to show the folly of accepting this hasty and\r\npartial evidence. A soldier may think, from the little part of the\r\nbattle he can see, that the day is going against him; but by holding his\r\nground stoutly he may help his comrades in another quarter to win the\r\nvictory. Successive waves may seem to rise no higher on the land, but\r\nfar back in swollen creek and inlet is proof that the tide is coming in.\r\nAs we look toward the east, we are discouraged at the slowness of\r\ndaybreak; but by looking westward we see the whole landscape illumined.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Say not the struggle nought availeth,\r\n    The labor and the wounds are vain,\r\n  The enemy faints not, nor faileth,\r\n    And as things have been they remain.\r\n\r\n  If hopes were dupes, fears may be liars;\r\n    It may be, in yon smoke conceal'd,\r\n  Your comrades chase e'en now the fliers,\r\n    And, but for you, possess the field.\r\n\r\n  For while the tired waves, vainly breaking,\r\n    Seem here no painful inch to gain,\r\n  Far back, through creeks and inlets making,\r\n    Comes silent, flooding in, the main.\r\n\r\n  And not by eastern windows only,\r\n    When daylight comes, comes in the light,\r\n  In front, the sun climbs", "mimetype": "text/plain",

daylight comes, comes in the light,\r\n  In front, the sun climbs slow, how slowly,\r\n    But westward, look, the land is bright.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Arthur Hugh Clough._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWORTH WHILE\r\n\r\n\r\nA little boy whom his mother had rebuked for not turning a deaf ear to\r\ntemptation protested, with tears, that he had no deaf ear. But\r\ntemptation, even when heard, must somehow be resisted. Yea, especially\r\nwhen heard! We deserve no credit for resisting it unless it comes to our\r\nears like the voice of the siren.\r\n\r\n\r\n  It is easy enough to be pleasant,\r\n    When life flows by like a song,\r\n  But the man worth while is one who will smile,\r\n    When everything goes dead wrong.\r\n  For the test of the heart is trouble,\r\n    And it always comes with the years,\r\n  And the smile that is worth the praises of earth,\r\n    Is the smile that shines through tears.\r\n\r\n  It is easy enough to be prudent,\r\n    When nothing tempts you to stray,\r\n  When without or within no voice of sin\r\n    Is luring your soul away;\r\n  But it's only a negative virtue\r\n    Until it is tried by fire,\r\n  And the life that is worth the honor on earth,\r\n    Is the one that resists desire.\r\n\r\n  By the cynic, the sad, the fallen,\r\n    Who had no strength for the strife,\r\n  The world's highway is cumbered to-day,\r\n    They make up the sum of life.\r\n  But the virtue that conquers passion,\r\n    And the sorrow that hides in a smile,\r\n  It is these that are worth the homage on earth\r\n    For we find them but once in a while.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ella Wheeler Wilcox._\r\n\r\nFrom \"Poems of Sentiment.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOPE\r\n\r\n\r\nGloom and despair are really ignorance in another form. They fail to\r\nreckon with the fact that what appears to be baneful often turns out to\r\nbe good. Lincoln lost the senatorship to Douglas and thought he had\r\nended his career; had he won the contest, he might have remained only a\r\nsenator. Life often has surprise parties for us. Things come to us\r\nmasked in gloom and black; but Time, the revealer, strips off the\r\ndisguise, and lo, what we have is blessings.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Never go gloomy, man with a mind,\r\n    Hope is a better companion than fear;\r\n  Providence, ever benignant and kind,\r\n    Gives with a smile what you take with a tear;\r\n      All will be right,\r\n      Look to the light.\r\n  Morning was ever the daughter of night;\r\n  All that was black will be all that is bright,\r\n     Cheerily, cheerily, then cheer up.\r\n\r\n  Many a foe is a friend in disguise,\r\n    Many a trouble a blessing most true,\r\n  Helping the heart to be happy and wise,\r\n    With love ever precious and joys ever new.\r\n      Stand in the van,\r\n      Strike like a man!\r\n  This is the bravest and cleverest plan;\r\n  Trusting in God while you do what you can.\r\n     Cheerily, cheerily, then cheer up.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Anonymous._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI'M GLAD\r\n\r\n\r\n  I'm glad the sky is painted blue;\r\n    And the earth is painted green;\r\n  And such a lot of nice fresh air\r\n    All sandwiched in between.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Anonymous._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHAMBERED NAUTILUS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe nautilus is a small mollusk that creeps upon the bottom of the sea,\r\nthough it used to be supposed to swim, or even to spread a kind of sail\r\nso that the wind might drive it along the surface. What interests us in\r\nthis poem is the way the nautilus _grows_. Just as a tree when sawed\r\ndown has the record of its age in the number of its rings, so does the\r\nnautilus measure its age by the ever-widening compartments of its shell.\r\nThese it has successively occupied. The poet, looking upon the now empty\r\nshell, thinks of human life as growing in the same way. We advance from\r\none state of being to another, each nobler than the one which preceded\r\nit, until the spirit leaves its shell altogether and attains a glorious\r\nand perfect freedom.\r\n\r\n\r\n  This is the ship of pearl, which, poets feign,\r\n    Sailed the unshadowed main,--\r\n    The venturous bark that flings\r\n  On the sweet summer wind", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx":

gulfs enchanted, where the Siren sings,\r\n    And coral reefs lie bare,\r\n  Where the cold sea-maids rise to sun their streaming hair.\r\n\r\n  Its webs of living gauze no more unfurl;\r\n    Wrecked is the ship of pearl!\r\n    And every chambered cell,\r\n  Where its dim dreaming life was wont to dwell,\r\n  As the frail tenant shaped his growing shell,\r\n    Before thee lies revealed,--\r\n  Its irised ceiling rent, its sunless crypt unsealed!\r\n\r\n  Year after year beheld the silent toil\r\n    That spread his lustrous coil;\r\n    Still, as the spiral grew,\r\n  He left the past year's dwelling for the new,\r\n  Stole with soft step its shining archway through,\r\n    Built up its idle door,\r\n  Stretched in his last-found home, and knew the old no more.\r\n\r\n  Thanks for the heavenly message brought by thee,\r\n    Child of the wandering sea,\r\n    Cast from her lap, forlorn!\r\n  From thy dead lips a clearer note is born\r\n  Than ever Triton blew from wreathed horn!\r\n    While on mine ear it rings,\r\n  Through the deep caves of thought I hear a voice that sings:--\r\n\r\n  Build thee more stately mansions, O my soul,\r\n    As the swift seasons roll!\r\n    Leave thy low-vaulted past!\r\n  Let each new temple, nobler than the last,\r\n  Shut thee from heaven with a dome more vast,\r\n    Till thou at length art free,\r\n  Leaving thine outgrown shell by life's unresting sea!\r\n\r\n\r\n_Oliver Wendell Holmes._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPIPPA'S SONG\r\n\r\n\r\nThis little song vibrates with an optimism that embraces the whole\r\nuniverse. A frequent error in quoting it is the substitution of the word\r\n_well_ for _right_. Browning is no such shallow optimist as to believe\r\nthat all is well with the world, but he does maintain that things are\r\nright with the world, for in spite of its present evils it is slowly\r\nworking its way toward perfection, and in the great scheme of things it\r\nmay make these evils themselves an instrument to move it toward its\r\nultimate goal.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The year's at the spring\r\n  And day's at the morn;\r\n  Morning's at seven;\r\n  The hillside's dew-pearled;\r\n  The lark's on the wing;\r\n  The snail's on the thorn;\r\n  God's in his heaven--\r\n  All's right with the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Robert Browning._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOWNERSHIP\r\n\r\n\r\nThe true value of anything lies, not in the object itself or in its\r\nlegal possession, but in our attitude to it. We may own a thing in fee\r\nsimple, yet derive from it nothing but vexation. For those who have\r\nlittle, as indeed for those who have much, there are no surer means of\r\nhappiness than enjoying that which they do not possess. Emerson shows us\r\nthat two harvests may be gathered from every field--a material one by\r\nthe man who raised the crop, and an esthetic or spiritual one by\r\nwhosoever can see beauty or thrill with an inner satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\r\n    They ride in Packards, those swell guys,\r\n  While I can't half afford a Ford;\r\n  Choice fillets fill a void for them,\r\n  We've cheese and prunes the place I board;\r\n  They've smirking servants hanging round,\r\n  You'd guess by whom my shoes are shined.\r\n  But all the same I'm rich as they,\r\n  For ownership's a state of mind.\r\n\r\n    _They_ own, you say? Pshaw, they possess!\r\n  And what a fellow has, has him!\r\n  The rich can't stop and just enjoy\r\n  Their lawns and shrubs and house-fronts trim.\r\n  They're tied indoors and foot the bills;\r\n  I stroll or stray, as I'm inclined--\r\n  Possession was not meant for use,\r\n  But ownership's a state of mind.\r\n\r\n    The folks who have must try to keep\r\n  Against the thieves who swarm and steal;\r\n  They dare not stride, they mince along--\r\n  Their pavement's a banana peel.\r\n  Who owns, the jeweler or I,\r\n  Yon gems by window-bars confined?\r\n  Possession lies in locks and keys;\r\n  True ownership's a state of mind.\r\n\r\n    I own my office (I've a boss,\r\n  But so have all men--so has he);\r\n  The business is not mine, but yet\r\n  I", "mimetype": "text/plain",

They are not content to be what they are; they wish to\r\nbe \"utterly other.\" Of course they are hollow, artificial, insincere;\r\nmoreover they are nuisances.

away,\r\n  With the joy that it's done the best of the pay,\r\n    Can you sing a song?\r\n\r\n\r\n_Joseph Morris._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKNOW THYSELF\r\n\r\n\r\nIt seems impossible that human beings could endure so much until we\r\nrealize that they _have_ endured it. The spirit of man performs\r\nmiracles; it transcends the limitations of flesh and blood. It is like\r\nUncle Remus's account of Brer Rabbit climbing a tree. \"A rabbit couldn't\r\ndo that,\" the little boy protested. \"He did,\" Uncle Remus responded; \"he\r\nwas jes' 'bleeged to.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n  Reined by an unseen tyrant's hand,\r\n  Spurred by an unseen tyrant's will,\r\n  Aquiver at the fierce command\r\n  That goads you up the danger hill,\r\n  You cry: \"O Fate, O Life, be kind!\r\n  Grant but an hour of respite--give\r\n  One moment to my suffering mind!\r\n  I can not keep the pace and live.\"\r\n  But Fate drives on and will not heed\r\n  The lips that beg, the feet that bleed.\r\n  Drives, while you faint upon the road,\r\n  Drives, with a menace for a goad;\r\n  With fiery reins of circumstance\r\n  Urging his terrible advance\r\n  The while you cry in your despair,\r\n  \"The pain is more than I can bear!\"\r\n\r\n  Fear not the goad, fear not the pace,\r\n  Plead not to fall from out the race--\r\n  It is your own Self driving you,\r\n  Your Self that you have never known,\r\n  Seeing your little self alone.\r\n  Your Self, high-seated charioteer,\r\n  Master of cowardice and fear,\r\n  Your Self that sees the shining length\r\n  Of all the fearful road ahead,\r\n  Knows that the terrors that you dread\r\n  Are pigmies to your splendid strength;\r\n  Strength you have never even guessed,\r\n  Strength that has never needed rest.\r\n  Your Self that holds the mastering rein,\r\n  Seeing beyond the sweat and pain\r\n  And anguish of your driven soul,\r\n  The patient beauty of the goal!\r\n\r\n  Fighting upon the terror field\r\n  Where man and Fate came breast to breast,\r\n  Prest by a thousand foes to yield,\r\n  Tortured and wounded without rest,\r\n  You cried: \"Be merciful, O Life--\r\n  The strongest spirit soon must break\r\n  Before this all-unequal strife,\r\n  This endless fight for failure's sake!\"\r\n  But Fate, unheeding, lifted high\r\n  His sword, and thrust you through to die,\r\n  And then there came one strong and great,\r\n  Who towered high o'er Chance and Fate,\r\n  Who bound your wound and eased your pain\r\n  And bade you rise and fight again.\r\n  And from some source you did not guess\r\n  Gushed a great tide of happiness--\r\n  A courage mightier than the sun--\r\n  You rose and fought and, fighting, won!\r\n\r\n  It was your own Self saving you,\r\n  Your Self no man has ever known,\r\n  Looking on flesh and blood alone.\r\n  That Self that lives so close to God\r\n  As roots that feed upon the sod.\r\n  That one who stands behind the screen,\r\n  Looks through the window of your eyes--\r\n  A being out of Paradise.\r\n  The Self no human eye has seen,\r\n  The living one who never tires,\r\n  Fed by the deep eternal fires.\r\n  Your flaming Self, with two-edged sword,\r\n  Made in the likeness of the Lord,\r\n  Angel and guardian at the gate,\r\n  Master of Death and King of Fate!\r\n\r\n\r\n_Angela Morgan._\r\n\r\nFrom \"The Hour Has Struck.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUST WHISTLE\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a psychological benefit in the mere physical act of whistling.\r\nWhen the body makes music, the spirit falls into harmonies too and the\r\ndiscords that assail us cease to make themselves heard.\r\n\r\n\r\n  When times are bad an' folks are sad\r\n    An' gloomy day by day,\r\n  Jest try your best at lookin' glad\r\n    An' whistle 'em away.\r\n\r\n  Don't mind how troubles bristle,\r\n  Jest take a rose or thistle.\r\n    Hold your own\r\n  An' change your tone\r\n  An' whistle, whistle, whistle!\r\n\r\n  A song is worth a world o' sighs.\r\n    When red the lightnings play,\r\n  Look for the rainbow in the skies\r\n    An' whistle 'em away.\r\n\r\n  Don't mind how troubles", "mimetype": "text/plain",

Then come the years and the struggles, and we are buffeted and\r\nbaffled, and our very ideal is eclipsed. But others have done better\r\nthan we. Weary and harassed, they yet embody our visions. And we, if we\r\nare worth our salt, do not envy them when we see them. Nor should we\r\ngrow dispirited. Rather should we rejoice in their triumph, rejoice that\r\nour dreams were not impossibilities, take courage to strive afresh for\r\nthat which we know is best.\r\n\r\n\r\n  I knew his face the moment that he passed\r\n    Triumphant in the thoughtless, cruel throng,--\r\n  Triumphant, though the quiet, tired eyes\r\n    Showed that his soul had suffered overlong.\r\n  And though across his brow faint lines of care\r\n  Were etched, somewhat of Youth still lingered there.\r\n  I gently touched his arm--he smiled at me--\r\n  He was the Man that Once I Meant to Be!\r\n\r\n  Where I had failed, he'd won from life, Success;\r\n    Where I had stumbled, with sure feet he stood;\r\n  Alike--yet unalike--we faced the world,\r\n    And through the stress he found that life was good\r\n  And I? The bitter wormwood in the glass,\r\n  The shadowed way along which failures pass!\r\n  Yet as I saw him thus, joy came to me--\r\n  He was the Man that Once I Meant to Be!\r\n\r\n  I knew him! And I knew he knew me for\r\n    The man HE might have been. Then did his soul\r\n  Thank silently the gods that gave him strength\r\n    To win, while I so sorely missed the goal?\r\n  He turned, and quickly in his own firm hand\r\n  He took my own--the gulf of Failure spanned, ...\r\n  And that was all--strong, self-reliant, free,\r\n  He was the Man that Once I Meant to Be!\r\n\r\n  We did not speak.

They look upon what is happy or\r\ninspiring with eyes that really fail to see. As Wordsworth says of Peter\r\nBell,\r\n\r\n  \"A primrose by the river's brim\r\n  A yellow primrose was to him,\r\n  And it was nothing more.\"\r\n\r\nBut to stop now and then and realize that the world is fresh and buoyant\r\nand happy, will do much to keep the spirit young. We should be glad that\r\nwe are alive, should tell ourselves often in the words of Charles Lamb:\r\n\"I am in love with this green earth.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n  The south wind is driving\r\n  His splendid cloud-horses\r\n    Through vast fields of blue.\r\n  The bare woods are singing,\r\n  The brooks in their courses\r\n  Are bubbling and springing\r\n  And dancing and leaping,\r\n  The violets peeping.\r\n  I'm glad to be living:\r\n    Aren't you?\r\n\r\n\r\n_Gamaliel Bradford._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHERE WILL ALWAYS BE SOMETHING TO DO\r\n\r\n\r\nAn old lady, famous for her ability to find in other people traits that\r\nshe could commend, was challenged to say a good word for the devil.\r\nAfter a moment's hesitation she answered, \"You must at least give him\r\ncredit for being industrious.\" Perhaps it is this superactivity of Satan\r\nthat causes beings less wickedly inclined to have such scope for the\r\nexercise of their qualities. Certain it is that nobody need hang back\r\nfrom want of something to do, to promote, to assail, to protect, to\r\nendure, or to sympathize with.\r\n\r\n\r\n  There will always be something to do, my boy;\r\n    There will always be wrongs to right;\r\n  There will always be need for a manly breed\r\n    And men unafraid to fight.\r\n  There will always be honor to guard, my boy;\r\n    There will always be hills to climb,\r\n  And tasks to do, and battles new\r\n    From now till the end of time.\r\n\r\n  There will always be dangers to face, my boy;\r\n    There will always be goals to take;\r\n  Men shall be tried, when the roads divide,\r\n    And proved by the choice they make.\r\n  There will always be burdens to bear, my boy;\r\n    There will always be need to pray;\r\n  There will always be tears through the future years,\r\n    As loved ones are borne away.\r\n\r\n  There will always be God to serve, my boy,\r\n    And always the Flag above;\r\n  They shall call to you until life is through\r\n    For courage and strength and love.\r\n  So these are things that I dream, my boy,\r\n    And have dreamed since your life began:\r\n  That whatever befalls, when the old world calls,\r\n    It shall find you a sturdy man.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Edgar A. Guest._\r\n\r\nFrom \"The Path to Home.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGOOD INTENTIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nThinking you would like a square meal will not in itself earn you one.\r\nThinking you would like a strong body will not without effort on your\r\npart make you an athlete. Thinking you would like to be kind or\r\nsuccessful will not bring you gentleness or achievement if you stop with\r\nmere thinking. The arrows of intention must have the bow of strong\r\npurpose to impel them.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The road to hell, they assure me,\r\n  With good intentions is paved;\r\n  And I know my desires are noble,\r\n  But my deeds might brand me depraved.\r\n  It's the warped grain in our nature,\r\n  And St. Paul has written it true:\r\n  \"The good that I would I do not;\r\n  But the evil I would not I do.\"\r\n\r\n  I've met few men who are monsters\r\n  When I came to know them inside;\r\n  Yet their bearing and dealings external\r\n  Are crusted with cruelty, pride,\r\n  Scorn, selfishness, envy, indifference,\r\n  Greed--why the long list pursue?\r\n  The good that", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 76038, "end_char_idx": 79979, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}",

fighting men, and fought by the rules of the\r\n          Game,\r\nAnd out of Life he has gathered--What? A living,--and little fame,\r\nEver and ever the Goal looms near,--seeming each time worth while;\r\nBut ever it proves a mirage fair--ever the grim gods smile.\r\nAnd so, with lips hard set and white, he buries the hope that is gone,--\r\nHis fight is lost--and he knows it is lost--and yet he is fighting on.\r\n\r\nOut of the smoke of the battle-line watching men win their way,\r\nAnd, cheering with those who cheer success, he enters again the fray,\r\nLicking the blood and the dust from his lips, wiping the sweat from his\r\n          eyes,\r\nHe does the work he is set to do--and \"therein honor lies.\"\r\nBrave they were, these men he cheered,--theirs is the winners' thrill;\r\n_His_ fight is lost--and he knows it is lost--and yet he is fighting still.\r\n\r\nAnd those who won have rest and peace; and those who died have more;\r\nBut, weary and spent, he can not stop seeking the ultimate score;\r\nCourage was theirs for a little time,--but what of the man who sees\r\nThat he must lose, yet will not beg mercy upon his knees?\r\nSide by side with grim Defeat, he struggles at dusk or dawn,--\r\nHis fight is lost--and he knows it is lost--and yet he is fighting on.\r\n\r\nPraise for the warriors who succeed, and tears for the vanquished dead;\r\nThe world will hold them close to her heart, wreathing each honored head,\r\nBut there in the ranks, soul-sick, time-tried, he battles against the odds,\r\n_Sans_ hope, but true to his colors torn, the plaything of the gods!\r\nUncover when he goes by, at last! Held to his task by _will_\r\nThe fight is lost--and he knows it is lost--and yet he is fighting still!\r\n\r\n\r\n_Everard Jack Appleton._\r\n\r\nFrom \"The Quiet Courage.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDUTY\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a single sentence Emerson crystallizes the faith that nothing is\r\nimpossible to those whose guide is duty. His words, though spoken\r\nprimarily of youth, apply to the whole of human life.\r\n\r\n\r\n  So nigh is grandeur to our dust,\r\n   So near is God to man,\r\n  When duty whispers low, _Thou must_,\r\n   The youth replies, _I can_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ralph Waldo Emerson._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CALL OF THE UNBEATEN\r\n\r\n\r\nP.T. Barnum had shrewdness, inventiveness, hair-trigger readiness in\r\nacting or deciding, an eye for hidden possibilities, an instinct for\r\ndetermining beforehand what would prove popular. All these qualities\r\nhelped him in his original and extraordinary career. But the quality he\r\nvalued most highly was the one he called \"stick-to-it-iveness.\" This\r\ncompleted the others. Without it the great showman could not have\r\nsucceeded at all. Nor did he think that any man who lacks it will make\r\nmuch headway in life.\r\n\r\n\r\n  We know how rough the road will be,\r\n  How heavy here the load will be,\r\n    We know about the barricades that wait along the track;\r\n  But we have set our soul ahead\r\n  Upon a certain goal ahead\r\n    And nothing left from hell to sky shall ever turn us back.\r\n\r\n  We know how brief all fame must be,\r\n  We know how crude the game must be,\r\n    We know how soon the cheering turns to jeering down the block;\r\n  But there's a deeper feeling here\r\n  That Fate can't scatter reeling here,\r\n    In knowing we have battled with the final ounce in stock.\r\n\r\n  We sing of no wild glory now,\r\n  Emblazoning some story now\r\n    Of mighty charges down the field beyond some guarded pit;\r\n  But humbler tasks befalling us,\r\n  Set duties that are calling us,\r\n    Where nothing left from hell to sky shall ever make us quit.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Grantland Rice._\r\n\r\nFrom \"The Sportlight.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLONIUS'S ADVICE TO LAERTES\r\n\r\n\r\nA father's advice to his son how to conduct himself in the world: Don't\r\ntell all you think, or put into action thoughts out of harmony or\r\nproportion with the occasion.

Dress well, but not ostentatiously. Neither borrow nor\r\nlend. And guarantee yourself against being false to others by setting up\r\nthe high moral principle of being true to yourself.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Give thy thoughts no tongue,\r\n  Nor any unproportion'd thought his act.\r\n  Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar;\r\n  The friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,\r\n  Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel;\r\n  But do not dull thy palm with entertainment\r\n  Of each new-hatch'd, unfledg'd comrade. Beware\r\n  Of entrance to a quarrel, but, being in,\r\n  Bear 't that th' opposed may beware of thee.\r\n  Give every man thine ear, but few thy voice;\r\n  Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.\r\n  Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,\r\n  But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;\r\n  For the apparel oft proclaims the man.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  Neither a borrower, nor a lender be;\r\n  For loan oft loses both itself and friend,\r\n  And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.\r\n  This above all: to thine own self be true,\r\n  And it must follow, as the night the day,\r\n  Thou canst not then be false to any man.\r\n\r\n\r\n_William Shakespeare._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW DO YOU TACKLE YOUR WORK?\r\n\r\n\r\nIt would be foolish to begin digging a tunnel through a mountain with a\r\nmere pick and spade. We must assemble for the task great mechanical\r\ncontrivances. And so with our energies of will; a slight tool means a\r\nslight achievement; a huge, aggressive engine, driving on at full blast,\r\nmeans corresponding bigness of results.\r\n\r\n\r\n  How do you tackle your work each day?\r\n    Are you scared of the job you find?\r\n  Do you grapple the task that comes your way\r\n    With a confident, easy mind?\r\n  Do you stand right up to the work ahead\r\n    Or fearfully pause to view it?\r\n  Do you start to toil with a sense of dread\r\n    Or feel that you're going to do it?\r\n\r\n  You can do as much as you think you can,\r\n    But you'll never accomplish more;\r\n  If you're afraid of yourself, young man,\r\n    There's little for you in store.\r\n  For failure comes from the inside first,\r\n    It's there if we only knew it,\r\n  And you can win, though you face the worst,\r\n    If you feel that you're going to do it.\r\n\r\n  Success! It's found in the soul of you,\r\n    And not in the realm of luck!\r\n  The world will furnish the work to do,\r\n    But you must provide the pluck.\r\n  You can do whatever you think you can,\r\n    It's all in the way you view it.\r\n  It's all in the start you make, young man:\r\n    You must feel that you're going to do it.\r\n\r\n  How do you tackle your work each day?\r\n    With confidence clear, or dread?\r\n  What to yourself do you stop and say\r\n    When a new task lies ahead?\r\n  What is the thought that is in your mind?\r\n    Is fear ever running through it?\r\n  If so, just tackle the next you find\r\n    By thinking you're going to do it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Edgar A.

Magazine.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAVING DONE AND DOING\r\n\r\n(ADAPTED FROM \"TROILUS AND CRESSIDA\")\r\n\r\n\r\nA member of Parliament, having succeeded notably in his maiden effort at\r\nspeech-making, remained silent through the rest of his career lest he\r\nshould not duplicate his triumph. This course was stupid; in time the\r\naddress which had brought him fame became a theme for disparagement and\r\nmockery. A man cannot rest upon his laurels, else he will soon lack the\r\nlaurels to rest on. If he has true ability, he must from time to time\r\nshow it, instead of asking us to recall what he did in the past. There\r\nis a natural instinct which makes the whole world kin. It is distrust of\r\na mere reputation. It is a hankering to be shown. Unless the evidence to\r\nset us right is forthcoming, we will praise dust which is gilded over\r\nrather than gold which is dusty from disuse.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Time hath, my lord, a wallet at his back,\r\n  Wherein he puts alms for oblivion,\r\n  A great-sized monster of ingratitudes:\r\n  Those scraps are good deeds past; which are devoured\r\n  As fast as they are made, forgot as soon\r\n  As done: perseverance, dear my lord,\r\n  Keeps honor bright: to have done, is to hang\r\n  Quite out of fashion, like a rusty mail\r\n  In monumental mockery. Take the instant way;\r\n  For honor travels in a strait so narrow\r\n  Where one but goes abreast: keep, then, the path;\r\n  For emulation hath a thousand sons\r\n  That one by one pursue: if you give way,\r\n  Or hedge aside from the direct forthright,\r\n  Like to an entered tide they all rush by\r\n  And leave you hindmost;\r\n  Or, like a gallant horse fallen in first rank,\r\n  Lie there for pavement to the abject rear,\r\n  O'errun and trampled on: then what they do in present,\r\n  Though less than yours in past, must o'ertop yours;\r\n  For time is like a fashionable host,\r\n  That slightly shakes his parting guest by the hand,\r\n  And with his arms outstretched, as he would fly,\r\n  Grasps in the comer: welcome ever smiles,\r\n  And farewell goes out sighing. O! let not virtue seek\r\n  Remuneration for the thing it was; for beauty, wit,\r\n  High birth, vigor of bone, desert in service,\r\n  Love, friendship, charity, are subjects all\r\n  To envious and calumniating time.\r\n  One touch of nature makes the whole world kin,\r\n  That all with one consent praise new-born gawds,\r\n  Though they are made and moulded of things past,\r\n  And give to dust that is a little gilt\r\n  More laud than gilt o'er-dusted.\r\n  The present eye praises the present object,\r\n  Since things in motion sooner catch the eye\r\n  Than what not stirs.\r\n\r\n\r\n_William Shakespeare._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFAITH\r\n\r\n\r\nFaith is not a passive thing--mere believing or waiting. It is an active\r\nthing--a positive striving and achievement, even if conditions be\r\nuntoward.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Faith is not merely praying\r\n    Upon your knees at night;\r\n  Faith is not merely straying\r\n    Through darkness to the light.\r\n\r\n  Faith is not merely waiting\r\n    For glory that may be,\r\n  Faith is not merely hating\r\n    The sinful ecstasy.\r\n\r\n  Faith is the brave endeavor\r\n    The splendid enterprise,\r\n  The strength to serve, whatever\r\n    Conditions may arise.\r\n\r\n\r\n_S.E.

It comes once and once only to every human\r\nbeing, wise or foolish, good or wicked. If it be not perceived on the\r\ninstant, it passes by forever. No longing for it, no effort, can bring\r\nit back. Notice that this view is fatalistic; it makes opportunity an\r\nexternal thing--one that enriches men or leaves their lives empty\r\nwithout much regard to what they deserve.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Master of human destinies am I!\r\n  Fame, love, and fortune on my footsteps wait.\r\n  Cities and fields I walk; I penetrate\r\n  Deserts and seas remote, and passing by\r\n  Hovel and mart and palace--soon or late\r\n  I knock, unbidden, once at every gate!\r\n  If sleeping, wake--if feasting, rise before\r\n  I turn away. It is the hour of fate,\r\n  And they who follow me reach every state\r\n  Mortals desire, and conquer every foe\r\n  Save death; but those who doubt or hesitate,\r\n  Condemned to failure, penury, and woe,\r\n  Seek me in vain and uselessly implore.\r\n  I answer not, and I return no more!\r\n\r\n\r\n_John James Ingalls._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOPPORTUNITY\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a tide in the affairs of men,\r\nWhich, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune;\r\nOmitted, all the voyage of their life\r\nIs bound in shallows and in miseries.\r\nOn such a full sea are we now afloat;\r\nAnd we must take the current when it serves,\r\nOr lose our ventures.\r\n\r\n\r\n_William Shakespeare._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOPPORTUNITY\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the thought of the preceding poem we have here a direct answer. No\r\nmatter how a man may have failed in the past, the door of opportunity is\r\nalways open to him. He should not give way to useless regrets; he should\r\nknow that the future is within his control, that it will be what he\r\nchooses to make it.\r\n\r\n\r\n  They do me wrong who say I come no more\r\n    When once I knock and fail to find you in;\r\n  For every day I stand outside your door,\r\n    And bid you wake, and rise to fight and win.\r\n\r\n  Wail not for precious chances passed away,\r\n    Weep not for golden ages on the wane!\r\n  Each night I burn the records of the day,--\r\n    At sunrise every soul is born again!\r\n\r\n  Laugh like a boy at splendors that have sped,\r\n    To vanished joys be blind and deaf and dumb;\r\n  My judgments seal the dead past with its dead,\r\n    But never bind a moment yet to come.\r\n\r\n  Though deep in mire, wring not your hands and weep;\r\n    I lend my arm to all who say \"I can!\"\r\n  No shame-faced outcast ever sank so deep,\r\n    But yet might rise and be again a man!\r\n\r\n  Dost thou behold thy lost youth all aghast?\r\n    Dost reel from righteous Retribution's blow?\r\n  Then turn from blotted archives of the past,\r\n    And find the future's pages white as snow.\r\n\r\n  Art thou a mourner? Rouse thee from thy spell;\r\n    Art thou a sinner? Sins may be forgiven;\r\n  Each morning gives thee wings to flee from hell,\r\n    Each night a star to guide thy feet to heaven.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Walter Malone._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOPPORTUNITY\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this poem yet another view of opportunity is presented. The recreant\r\nor the dreamer complains that he has no real chance. He would succeed,\r\nhe says, if he had but the implements of success--money, influence,\r\nsocial prestige, and the like. But success lies far less in implements\r\nthan in the use we make of them. What one man throws away as useless,\r\nanother man seizes as the best means of victory at hand. For every one\r\nof us the materials for achievement are sufficient.

not\r\nto answer the dogs or to waste strength placating them, but simply to\r\nshine. The man who strives or succeeds is sure to be criticized. Is he\r\ntherefore to abstain from all effort? We are responsible for our own\r\nlives and cannot regulate them according to other people's ideas. \"Whoso\r\nwould be a man,\" says Emerson, \"must be a nonconformist.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n  I allus argy that a man\r\n  Who does about the best he can\r\n  Is plenty good enugh to suit\r\n  This lower mundane institute--\r\n  No matter ef his daily walk\r\n  Is subject fer his neghbor's talk,\r\n  And critic-minds of ev'ry whim\r\n  Jest all git up and go fer him!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  It's natchurl enugh, I guess,\r\n  When some gits more and some gits less,\r\n  Fer them-uns on the slimmest side\r\n  To claim it ain't a fare divide;\r\n  And I've knowed some to lay and wait,\r\n  And git up soon, and set up late,\r\n  To ketch some feller they could hate\r\n  For goin' at a faster gait.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  My doctern is to lay aside\r\n  Contensions, and be satisfied:\r\n  Jest do your best, and praise er blame\r\n  That follers that, counts jest the same.\r\n  I've allus noticed grate success\r\n  Is mixed with troubles, more er less,\r\n  And it's the man who does the best\r\n  That gits more kicks than all the rest.\r\n\r\n\r\n_James Whitcomb Riley._\r\n\r\nFrom the Biographical Edition\r\nOf the Complete Works of James Whitcomb Riley.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nULYSSES\r\n\r\n\r\nThis volume consists chiefly of contemporary or very recent verse. But\r\nit could not serve its full purpose without the presence, here and\r\nthere, of older poems--of \"classics.\" These express a truth, a mood, or\r\na spirit that is universal, and they express it in words of noble\r\ndignity and beauty. They are not always easy to understand; they are\r\ncrops we must patiently cultivate, not crops that volunteer. But they\r\nwear well; they grow upon us; we come back to them again and again, and\r\nstill they are fresh, living, significant--not empty, meaningless, and\r\nweather-worn, like a last year's crow's nest.\r\n\r\nSuch a poem is _Ulysses_. It is shot through and through with the spirit\r\nof strenuous and never-ceasing endeavor--a spirit manifest in a hero who\r\nhas every temptation to rest and enjoy. Ulysses is old. After ten long\r\nyears of warfare before Troy, after endless misfortunes on his homeward\r\nvoyage, after travels and experiences that have taken him everywhere and\r\nshown him everything that men know and do, he has returned to his rude\r\nnative kingdom. He is reunited with his wife Penelope and his son\r\nTelemachus. He is rich and famous. Yet he is unsatisfied. The task and\r\nroutine of governing a slow, materially minded people, though suited to\r\nhis son's temperament, are unsuited to his. He wants to wear out rather\r\nthan to rust out. He wants to discover what the world still holds. He\r\nwants to drink life to the lees. The morning has passed, the long day\r\nhas waned, twilight and the darkness are at hand. But scant as are the\r\nyears left to him, he will use them in a last, incomparable quest.

vast; unsubdued enterprise.\r\n\r\n\r\n  It little profits that an idle king,\r\n  By this still hearth, among these barren crags,\r\n  Match'd with an aged wife, I mete and dole\r\n  Unequal laws unto a savage race,\r\n  That hoard, and sleep, and feed, and know not me.\r\n  I cannot rest from travel; I will drink\r\n  Life to the lees. All times I have enjoy'd\r\n  Greatly, have suffer'd greatly, both with those\r\n  That loved me, and alone; on shore, and when\r\n  Thro' scudding drifts the rainy Hyades\r\n  Vext the dim sea. I am become a name;\r\n  For always roaming with a hungry heart\r\n  Much have I seen and known,--cities of men\r\n  And manners, climates, councils, governments,\r\n  Myself not least, but honor'd of them all,--\r\n  And drunk delight of battle with my peers,\r\n  Far on the ringing plains of windy Troy.\r\n  I am a part of all that I have met;\r\n  Yet all experience is an arch wherethro'\r\n  Gleams that untravell'd world whose margin fades\r\n  For ever and for ever when I move.\r\n  How dull it is to pause, to make an end,\r\n  To rust unburnish'd, not to shine in use!\r\n  As tho' to breathe were life! Life piled on life\r\n  Were all too little, and of one to me\r\n  Little remains; but every hour is saved\r\n  From that eternal silence, something more,\r\n  A bringer of new things; and vile it were\r\n  For some three suns to store and hoard myself,\r\n  And this gray spirit yearning in desire\r\n  To follow knowledge like a sinking star,\r\n  Beyond the utmost bound of human thought.\r\n    This is my son, mine own Telemachus,\r\n  To whom I leave the sceptre and the isle,--\r\n  Well-beloved of me, discerning to fulfil\r\n  This labor, by slow prudence to make mild\r\n  A rugged people, and thro' soft degrees\r\n  Subdue them to the useful and the good.\r\n  Most blameless is he, centred in the sphere\r\n  Of common duties, decent not to fail\r\n  In offices of tenderness, and pay\r\n  Meet adoration to my household gods,\r\n  When I am gone. He works his work, I mine.\r\n    There lies the port; the vessel puffs her sail;\r\n  There gloom the dark, broad seas. My mariners,\r\n  Souls that have toil'd, and wrought, and thought with me,--\r\n  That ever with a frolic welcome took\r\n  The thunder and the sunshine, and opposed\r\n  Free hearts, free foreheads,--you and I are old;\r\n  Old age hath yet his honor and his toil.\r\n  Death closes all; but something ere the end,\r\n  Some work of noble note, may yet be done,\r\n  Not unbecoming men that strove with Gods.\r\n  The lights begin to twinkle from the rocks;\r\n  The long day wanes; the slow moon climbs; the deep\r\n  Moans round with many voices. Come, my friends.\r\n  'Tis not too late to seek a newer world.\r\n  Push off, and sitting well in order smite\r\n  The sounding furrows; for my purpose holds\r\n  To sail beyond the sunset, and the baths\r\n  Of all the western stars, until I die.\r\n  It may be that the gulfs will wash us down;\r\n  It may be we shall touch the Happy Isles,\r\n  And see the great Achilles, whom we knew.\r\n  Tho' much is taken, much abides; and tho'\r\n  We are not now that strength which in old days\r\n  Moved earth and heaven, that which we are, we are,--\r\n  One equal temper of heroic hearts,\r\n  Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will\r\n  To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Alfred Tennyson._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREPAREDNESS\r\n\r\n\r\n  For all your days

The logs I let pass have grown on the side of a\r\nmountain, where they have been protected all their lives. Their grain is\r\ncoarse; they are good only for lumber. But these logs, seignior, grew on\r\nthe top of the mountain. From the time they were sprouts and saplings\r\nthey were lashed and buffeted by the winds, and so they grew strong with\r\nfine grain.

sympathize, to understand, to help, to trust, to\r\nstruggle, to aspire.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Thank God I can rejoice\r\n  In human things--the multitude's glad voice,\r\n  The street's warm surge beneath the city light,\r\n  The rush of hurrying faces on my sight,\r\n  The million-celled emotion in the press\r\n  That would their human fellowship confess.\r\n  Thank Thee because I may my brother feed,\r\n  That Thou hast opened me unto his need,\r\n  Kept me from being callous, cold and blind,\r\n  Taught me the melody of being kind.\r\n  Thus, for my own and for my brother's sake--\r\n      Thank Thee I am awake!\r\n\r\n  Thank Thee that I can trust!\r\n  That though a thousand times I feel the thrust\r\n  Of faith betrayed, I still have faith in man,\r\n  Believe him pure and good since time began--\r\n  Thy child forever, though he may forget\r\n  The perfect mould in which his soul was set.\r\n  Thank Thee that when love dies, fresh love springs up.\r\n  New wonders pour from Heaven's cup.\r\n  Young to my soul the ancient need returns,\r\n  Immortal in my heart the ardor burns;\r\n  My altar fires replenished from above--\r\n      Thank Thee that I can love!\r\n\r\n  Thank Thee that I can hear,\r\n  Finely and keenly with the inner ear,\r\n  Below the rush and clamor of a throng\r\n  The mighty music of the under-song.\r\n  And when the day has journeyed to its rest,\r\n  Lo, as I listen, from the amber west,\r\n  Where the great organ lifts its glowing spires,\r\n  There sounds the chanting of the unseen choirs.\r\n  Thank Thee for sight that shows the hidden flame\r\n  Beneath all breathing, throbbing things the same,\r\n  Thy Pulse the pattern of the thing to be....\r\n      Thank Thee that I can see!\r\n\r\n  Thank Thee that I can feel!\r\n  That though life's blade be terrible as steel,\r\n  My soul is stript and naked to the fang,\r\n  I crave the stab of beauty and the pang.\r\n  _To be alive,\r\n  To think, to yearn, to strive,_\r\n  To suffer torture when the goal is wrong,\r\n  To be sent back and fashioned strong\r\n  Rejoicing in the lesson that was taught\r\n  By all the good the grim experience wrought;\r\n  At last, exulting, to _arrive_....\r\n      Thank God I am alive!\r\n\r\n\r\n_Angela Morgan._\r\n\r\nFrom \"The Hour Has Struck.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLOSE THE DAY LOITERING\r\n\r\n\r\nAnything is hard to begin, whether it

Form the\r\nexcellent habit of making a start.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Lose the day loitering, 'twill be the same story\r\n  To-morrow, and the next more dilatory,\r\n  For indecision brings its own delays,\r\n  And days are lost lamenting o'er lost days.\r\n  Are you in earnest? Seize this very minute!\r\n  What you can do, or think you can, begin it!\r\n  Only engage, and then the mind grows heated;\r\n  Begin it, and the work will be completed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Johann Wolfgang von Goethe._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPLAYING THE GAME\r\n\r\n\r\nWe don't like the man who whines that the cards were stacked against him\r\nor that the umpire cheated. We admire the chap who, when he must take\r\nhis medicine, takes it cheerfully, bravely. To play the game steadily is\r\na merit, whether the game be a straight one or crooked. A thoroughbred,\r\neven though bad, has more of our respect than the craven who cleaves to\r\nthe proprieties solely from fear to violate them. It has well been said:\r\n\"The mistakes which make us men are better than the accuracies that keep\r\nus children.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n  Yes, he went an' stole our steers,\r\n    So, of course, he had to die;\r\n  I ain't sheddin' any tears,\r\n    But, when I cash in--say, I\r\n    Want to take it like that guy--\r\n  Laughin', jokin', with the rest,\r\n    Not a whimper, not a cry,\r\n  Standin' up to meet the test\r\n    Till we swung him clear an' high,\r\n  With his face turned toward the west!\r\n\r\n  Here's the way it looks to me;\r\n  Cattle thief's no thing to be,\r\n  But if you take up that trade,\r\n  Be the best one ever made;\r\n  If you've got a thing to do\r\n  Do it strong an' SEE IT THROUGH!\r\n\r\n  That was him! He played the game,\r\n    Took his chances, bet his hand,\r\n  When at last the showdown came\r\n    An' he lost, he kept his sand;\r\n  Didn't weep an' didn't pray,\r\n    Didn't waver er repent,\r\n  Simply tossed his cards away,\r\n    Knowin' well just what it meant.\r\n  Never claimed the deck was stacked,\r\n    Never called the game a snide,\r\n  Acted like a man should act,\r\n    Took his medicine--an' died!\r\n\r\n  So I say it here again,\r\n  What I think is true of men;\r\n  They should try to do what's right,\r\n  Fair an' square an' clean an' white,\r\n  But, whatever is their line,\r\n  Bad er good er foul er fine,\r\n  Let 'em go the Limit, play\r\n  Like a plunger, that's the way!\r\n\r\n\r\n_Berton Braley._\r\n\r\nFrom \"Songs of the Workaday World.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHARLOTTE PERKINS GILMAN]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRESOLVE\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are some things we should all resolve to do.

Only\r\nstruggle and suffering can give a man the qualities that enable him to\r\nrender large service to humanity. Lincoln was born in a log cabin. He\r\nsplit rails, and conned a few books by the firelight in the evening. He\r\nbecame a backwoods lawyer with apparently no advantages or encouraging\r\nprospects.

with all her heart\r\n  To create so great and bold a man\r\n  That all the world shall praise--\r\n  Watch her method, watch her ways!\r\n  How she ruthlessly perfects\r\n  Whom she royally elects;\r\n  How she hammers him and hurts him\r\n  And with mighty blows converts him\r\n  Into trial shapes of clay which only Nature understands--\r\n  While his tortured heart is crying and he lifts beseeching hands!--\r\n  How she bends, but never breaks,\r\n  When his good she undertakes....\r\n  How she uses whom she chooses\r\n  And with every purpose fuses him,\r\n  By every art induces him\r\n  To try his splendor out--\r\n  Nature knows what she's about.\r\n\r\n  When Nature wants to take a man\r\n  And shake a man\r\n  And wake a man;\r\n  When Nature wants to make a

she goads and never spares him,\r\n  How she whets him and she frets him\r\n  And in poverty begets him....\r\n  How she often disappoints\r\n  Whom she sacredly anoints,\r\n  With what wisdom she

wants to shame a man\r\n  To do his heavenly best....\r\n  When she tries the highest test\r\n  That her reckoning may bring--\r\n  When she wants a god or king!--\r\n  How she reins him and restrains

sweet\r\n  And love and hope are burning in the presence of defeat....\r\n  Lo, the crisis! Lo, the shout\r\n  That must call the leader out.\r\n  When the people need salvation\r\n    Doth he come to lead the nation....\r\n  Then doth Nature show her plan\r\n  When the world has found--a man!\r\n\r\n\r\n_Angela Morgan._\r\n\r\nFrom \"Forward, March!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER AND THE BEES\r\n\r\n(FROM \"HENRY V.\")\r\n\r\n\r\nWe often wish that we might do some other man's work, occupy his social\r\nor political station.

Creatures that by a rule in nature teach\r\n  The act of order to a peopled kingdom.\r\n  They have a king and officers of sorts;\r\n  Where some, like magistrates, correct at home,\r\n  Others, like merchants, venture trade abroad,\r\n  Others, like soldiers, arm\u00e9d in their stings,\r\n  Make boot upon the summer's velvet buds;\r\n  Which pillage they with merry march bring home\r\n  To the

Shasta,\r\nthough it towers for thousands of feet above its neighbors, does not\r\nrepine that it is alone or that the adjacent peaks see much that it\r\nmisses under the clouds. Nature does not trouble itself about what the\r\nrest of nature is doing. But man constantly worries about other\r\nmen--what they think of him, do to him, fail to emulate in him, have or\r\nsecure in comparison with him. He lacks nature's inward quietude.\r\nCalmness and peace come by being self-contained.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Weary of myself, and sick of asking\r\n  What I am, and what I ought to be,\r\n  At this vessel's prow I stand, which bears me\r\n  Forwards, forwards, o'er the starlit sea.\r\n\r\n  And a look of passionate desire\r\n  O'er the sea and to the stars I send:\r\n  \"Ye who from my childhood up have calmed me,\r\n  Calm me, ah, compose me to the end!\r\n\r\n  \"Ah, once more,\" I cried, \"ye stars, ye waters,\r\n  On my heart your mighty charm renew;\r\n  Still, still let me, as I gaze upon you,\r\n  Feel my soul becoming vast like you!\"\r\n\r\n  From the intense, clear, star-sown vault of heaven,\r\n  Over the lit sea's unquiet way,\r\n  In the rustling night-air came the answer:\r\n  \"Wouldst thou BE as these are? LIVE as they.\r\n\r\n  \"Unaffrighted by the silence round them,\r\n  Undistracted by the sights they see,\r\n  These demand not that the things without them\r\n  Yield them love, amusement, sympathy.\r\n\r\n  \"And with joy the stars perform their shining,\r\n  And the sea its long, moon-silver'd roll;\r\n  For self-poised they live, nor pine with noting\r\n  All the fever of some differing soul.\r\n\r\n  \"Bounded by themselves, and unregardful\r\n  In what state God's other works may be,\r\n  In their own tasks all their powers pouring,\r\n  These attain the mighty life you see.\"\r\n\r\n  O air-born voice! long since, severely clear,\r\n  A cry like thine in mine own heart I hear:\r\n  \"Resolve to be thyself; and know that he\r\n  Who finds himself, loses his misery!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Matthew Arnold._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA LITTLE PRAYER\r\n\r\n\r\nWe should strive to bring what happiness we can to others. More still,\r\nwe should strive to bring them no unhappiness. When we come to die, it\r\nis, as George Eliot once said, not our kindness or our patience or our\r\ngenerosity that we shall regret, but our intolerance and our harshness.\r\n\r\n\r\n  That I may not in blindness grope,\r\n    But that I may with vision clear\r\n  Know when to speak a word of hope\r\n    Or add a little wholesome cheer.\r\n\r\n  That tempered winds may softly blow\r\n    Where little children, thinly clad,\r\n  Sit dreaming, when the flame is low,\r\n    Of comforts they have never had.\r\n\r\n  That through the year which lies ahead\r\n    No heart shall ache, no cheek be wet,\r\n  For any word that I have said\r\n    Or profit I have tried to get.\r\n\r\n\r\n_S.E.

But Lee, though too maimed to\r\nattack, would not leave the field save of his own volition. \"If\r\nMcClellan wants a battle,\" he declared, \"he can have it.\" McClellan\r\nhesitated, and through the whole of the next day kept his great army\r\nidle.

with his wine.\r\n  Life it ain't no celebration.\r\n    Trouble? I've had mine--\r\n    But to-day is fine.\r\n\r\n  It's to-day that I am livin',\r\n    Not a month ago,\r\n  Havin', losin', takin', givin',\r\n    As time wills it so.\r\n  Yesterday a cloud of sorrow\r\n    Fell across the way;\r\n  It may rain again to-morrow,\r\n    It may rain--but, say,\r\n    Ain't it fine to-day!\r\n\r\n\r\n_Douglas Malloch._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ARROW AND THE SONG\r\n\r\n\r\nWe can calculate with fair accuracy the number of miles an automobile\r\nwill go in an hour. We can gauge pretty closely the amount of\r\nmerchandise a given sum of money will buy. But a good deed or a kind\r\nimpulse is not measurable. Their influence works in devious ways and\r\nlives on when perhaps we can see them no more.\r\n\r\n\r\n  I shout an arrow into the air,\r\n  It fell to earth, I knew not where;\r\n  For, so swiftly it flew, the sight\r\n  Could not follow it in its flight.\r\n\r\n  I breathed a song into the air,\r\n  It fell to earth, I knew not where;\r\n  For who has sight so keen and strong,\r\n  That it can follow the flight of song?\r\n\r\n  Long, long afterward, in an oak\r\n  I found the arrow, still unbroke;\r\n  And the song, from beginning to end,\r\n  I found again in the heart of a friend.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Henry Wadsworth Longfellow._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE INNER LIGHT\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"Thrice is he armed that hath his quarrel just,\r\n  And he but naked, though locked up in steel,\r\n  Whose conscience with injustice is corrupted,\"\r\n\r\nsays Shakespeare. But not only does a clear conscience give power; it\r\nalso gives light. With it we could sit at the center of the earth and\r\nyet enjoy the sunshine. Without it we live in a rayless prison.\r\n\r\n\r\n  He that has light within his own clear breast\r\n  May sit i' the center, and enjoy bright day:\r\n  But he that hides a dark soul and foul thoughts\r\n  Benighted walks under the midday sun;\r\n  Himself is his own dungeon.\r\n\r\n\r\n_John Milton._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE THINGS THAT HAVEN'T BEEN DONE BEFORE\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is said that if you hold a stick in front of the foremost sheep in a\r\nflock that files down a trail in the mountains, he will jump it--and\r\nthat every sheep thereafter will jump when he reaches the spot, even if\r\nthe stick be removed. So are many people mere unthinking imitators,\r\nblind to facts and opportunities about them. Kentucky could not be lived\r\nin by the white race till Daniel Boone built his cabin there. The air\r\nwas not part of the domain of humanity till the Wright brothers made\r\nthemselves birdmen.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The things that haven't been done before,\r\n    Those are the things to try;\r\n  Columbus dreamed of an unknown shore\r\n    At the rim of the far-flung sky,\r\n  And his heart was bold and his faith was strong\r\n    As he ventured in dangers new,\r\n  And he paid no heed to the jeering throng\r\n    Or the fears of the doubting crew.\r\n\r\n  The many will follow the beaten track\r\n    With guideposts on the way,\r\n  They live and have lived for ages back\r\n    With a chart for every day.\r\n  Someone has told them it's safe to go\r\n    On the road he has traveled o'er,\r\n  And all that they ever strive to know\r\n    Are the things that were known before.\r\n\r\n  A few strike out, without map or chart,\r\n    Where never a man has been,\r\n  From the beaten paths they draw apart\r\n    To see what no man has seen.\r\n  There are deeds they hunger alone to do;\r\n    Though battered and bruised and sore,\r\n  They blaze the path for the many, who\r\n    Do nothing not done before.\r\n\r\n  The things that haven't been done before\r\n    Are the tasks worth while to-day;\r\n  Are you one of the flock that follows, or\r\n    Are you one that shall lead the way?\r\n  Are you one of the timid souls that quail\r\n    At the jeers of a doubting crew,\r\n  Or dare you, whether you win or fail,\r\n    Strike out for a goal that's new?\r\n\r\n\r\n_Edgar A.

battle fails. I've\r\n  just been reading of a gent who joined the has-been ranks, at\r\n  fifty years without a cent, or credit at the banks. But\r\n  undismayed he buckled down, refusing to be beat, and captured\r\n  fortune and renown; he's now on Easy Street. Men say that\r\n  fellows down and out ne'er leave the rocky track, but facts\r\n  will show, beyond a doubt, that has-beens do come back. I know,\r\n  for I who write this rhyme, when forty-odd years old, was down\r\n  and out, without a dime, my whiskers full of mold. By black\r\n  disaster I was trounced until it jarred my spine; I was a\r\n  failure so pronounced I didn't need a sign. And after I had\r\n  soaked my coat, I said (at forty-three), \"I'll see if I can\r\n  catch the goat that has escaped from me.\" I labored hard; I\r\n  strained my dome, to do my daily grind, until in triumph I came\r\n  home, my billy-goat behind. And any man who still has health\r\n  may with the winners stack, and have a chance at fame and\r\n  wealth--for has-beens do come back.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Walt Mason._\r\n\r\nFrom \"Walt Mason, His Book.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWISHING\r\n\r\n\r\nHorace Greeley said that no one need fear the editor who indulged in\r\ndiatribes against the prevalence of polygamy in Utah, but that\r\nmalefactors had better look out when an editor took up his pen against\r\nabuses in his own city. We all tend to begin our reforms too far away\r\nfrom home. The man who wishes improvement strongly enough to set to work\r\non himself is the man who will obtain results.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Do you wish the world were better?\r\n    Let me tell you what to do.\r\n  Set a watch upon your actions,\r\n    Keep them always straight and true.\r\n  Rid your mind of selfish motives,\r\n    Let your thoughts be clean and high.\r\n  You can make a little Eden\r\n    Of the sphere you occupy.\r\n\r\n  Do you wish the world were wiser?\r\n    Well, suppose you make a start,\r\n  By accumulating wisdom\r\n    In the scrapbook of your heart;\r\n  Do not waste one page on folly;\r\n    Live to learn, and learn to live.\r\n  If you want to give men knowledge\r\n    You must get it, ere you give.\r\n\r\n  Do you wish the world were happy?\r\n    Then remember day by day\r\n  Just to scatter seeds of kindness\r\n    As you pass along the way,\r\n  For the pleasures of the many\r\n    May be ofttimes traced to one.\r\n  As the hand that plants an acorn\r\n    Shelters armies from the sun.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ella Wheeler Wilcox._\r\n\r\nFrom \"Poems of Power.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAWARENESS\r\n\r\n\r\nA man must keep a keen sense of the drift and significance of what he is\r\nengaged in if he is to make much headway. Yet many human beings are so\r\nsunk in the routine of their work that they fail to realize what it is\r\nall for. A man who was tapping with a hammer the wheels of a railroad\r\ntrain remarked that he had been at the job for twenty-seven years. \"What\r\ndo you do when a wheel doesn't sound right?\" a passenger inquired. The\r\nman was taken aback. \"I never found one that sounded that way,\" said he.\r\n\r\n\r\n  God--let me be aware.\r\n  Let me not stumble blindly down the ways,\r\n  Just getting somehow safely through the days,\r\n  Not even groping for another hand,\r\n  Not even wondering why it all was planned,\r\n  Eyes to the ground unseeking for the light,\r\n  Soul never aching for a wild-winged flight,\r\n  Please, keep me eager just to do my share.\r\n  God--let me be aware.\r\n\r\n  God--let me be aware.\r\n  Stab my soul fiercely with others' pain,\r\n  Let me walk seeing horror and stain.\r\n  Let my hands, groping, find other hands.\r\n  Give me the heart that divines, understands.\r\n  Give me the courage, wounded, to fight.\r\n  Flood me with knowledge, drench me in light.\r\n  Please--keep me eager just to do my share.\r\n  God--let me be aware.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Miriam Teichner._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nONE OF THESE DAYS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe worst", "mimetype": "text/plain",

Is the fault less when men are guilty of it?\r\nBehind us is much that we have found to be faithless, cruel, or\r\nunpleasant. Why go back to that? Why not go forward to the things we\r\nreally desire?\r\n\r\n\r\n  Say! Let's forget it! Let's put it aside!\r\n  Life is so large and the world is so wide.\r\n  Days are so short and there's so much to do,\r\n  What if it was false--there's plenty that's true.\r\n  Say! Let's forget it! Let's brush it away\r\n  Now and forever, so what do you say?\r\n  All of the bitter words said may be praise\r\n  One of these days.\r\n\r\n  Say! Let's forget it! Let's wipe off the slate,\r\n  Find something better to cherish than hate.\r\n  There's so much good in the world that we've had,\r\n  Let's strike a balance and cross off the bad.\r\n  Say! Let's forgive it, whatever it be,\r\n  Let's not be slaves when we ought to be free.\r\n  We shall be walking in sunshiny ways\r\n  One of these days.\r\n\r\n  Say! Let's not mind it! Let's smile it away,\r\n  Bring not a withered rose from yesterday;\r\n  Flowers are so fresh from the wayside and wood,\r\n  Sorrows are blessings but half understood.\r\n  Say! Let's not mind it, however it seems,\r\n  Hope is so sweet and holds so many dreams;\r\n  All of the sere fields with blossoms shall blaze\r\n  One of these days.\r\n\r\n  Say! Let's not take it so sorely to heart!\r\n  Hates may be friendships just drifted apart,\r\n  Failure be genius not quite understood,\r\n  Say! Let's get closer to somebody's side,\r\n  See what his dreams are and learn how he tried,\r\n  See if our scoldings won't give way to praise\r\n  One of these days.\r\n\r\n  Say! Let's not wither! Let's branch out and rise\r\n  Out of the byways and nearer the skies.\r\n  Let's spread some shade that's refreshing and deep\r\n  Where some tired traveler may lie down and sleep.\r\n  Say! Let's not tarry! Let's do it right now;\r\n  So much to do if we just find out how!\r\n  We may not be here to help folks or praise\r\n  One of these days.\r\n\r\n\r\n_James W.

The songs he has sung are\r\nless sweet than those he has dreamed of singing; the wishes he has\r\nwrought into facts are less noble than those that are yet unfulfilled.\r\nBut he looks forward to the time when all that he desires for humankind\r\nshall yet come to pass. The praise will not be his; it will belong to\r\nothers. Still, he does not envy those who are destined to succeed where\r\nhe failed. Rather does he rejoice that through them his hopes for the\r\nrace will be realized. And he is happy that by longing for just such a\r\ntriumph he shares in it--he makes it _his_ triumph.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Let the thick curtain fall;\r\n  I better know than all\r\n  How little I have gained,\r\n  How vast the unattained.\r\n\r\n  Not by the page word-painted\r\n  Let life be banned or sainted:\r\n  Deeper than written scroll\r\n  The colors of the soul.\r\n\r\n  Sweeter than any sung\r\n  My songs that found no tongue\r\n  Nobler than any fact\r\n  My wish that failed to act.\r\n\r\n  Others shall sing the", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 143107, "end_char_idx":

First is the freedom brought by love, when his\r\nsweetheart speaks to him through the grate of the dungeon. Second is the\r\nfreedom brought by the recollection of good fellowship, when tried and\r\ntrue comrades took their wine straight--\"with no allaying Thames.\" Third\r\nis the freedom brought by remembrance of the king for whom he was\r\nsuffering. Finally comes the passionate and heroic assertion that though\r\nthe body of a man may be confined, nevertheless his spirit can remain\r\nfree and chainless.\r\n\r\n\r\n  When Love with unconfin\u00e9d wings\r\n    Hovers within my gates,\r\n  And my divine Althea brings\r\n    To whisper at the grates;\r\n  When I lie tangled in her hair\r\n    And fetter'd to her eye,\r\n  The Gods that wanton in the air\r\n    Know no such liberty.\r\n\r\n  When flowing cups run swiftly round\r\n    With no allaying Thames,\r\n  Our careless heads with roses bound,\r\n    Our hearts with loyal flames;\r\n  When thirsty grief in wine we steep,\r\n    When healths and draughts go free--\r\n  Fishes that tipple in the deep\r\n    Know no such liberty.\r\n\r\n  When (like committed linnets) I\r\n    With shriller throat shall sing\r\n  The sweetness, mercy, majesty\r\n    And glories of my King;\r\n  When I shall voice aloud how good\r\n    He is, how great should be,\r\n  Enlarged winds, that curl the flood,\r\n    Know no such liberty.\r\n\r\n  Stone walls do not a prison make,\r\n    Nor iron bars a cage;\r\n  Minds innocent and quiet take\r\n    That for an hermitage;\r\n  If I have freedom in my love\r\n    And in my soul am free,\r\n  Angels alone, that soar above,\r\n    Enjoy such liberty.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Richard Lovelace._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGRIEF\r\n\r\n\r\nShakespeare says: \"I can easier teach twenty what were good to be done,\r\nthan be one of the twenty to follow mine own teaching.\" This is\r\nespecially true regarding grief or affliction. \"Man was born unto\r\ntrouble, as the sparks fly upward,\" but we bid other people bear their\r\nsorrows manfully; we should therefore bear ours with equal courage.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Upon this trouble shall I whet my life\r\n  As 'twere a dulling knife;\r\n  Bade I my friend be brave?\r\n  I shall still braver be.\r\n  No man shall say of me,\r\n  \"Others he saved, himself he cannot save.\"\r\n  But swift and fair\r\n  As the Primeval word that smote the night--\r\n  \"Let there be light!\"\r\n  Courage shall leap from me, a gallant sword\r\n  To rout the enemy and all his horde,\r\n  Cleaving a kingly pathway through despair.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Angela", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 147020, "end_char_idx": 150950, "text_template":

deeper understanding that clears up our misconceptions;\r\nit shows us the error of our hates; it dispels our worries and our\r\nfears; it allays the grief that seemed too poignant to be borne.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Yes, things are more or less amiss;\r\n  To-day it's that, to-morrow this;\r\n  Yet with so much that's out of whack,\r\n  Life does not wholly jump the track\r\n  Because, since matters move along,\r\n  No _one_ thing's always _staying_ wrong.\r\n  So heed not failures, losses, fears,\r\n  But trust the rectifying years.\r\n\r\n  What we shall have's not what we've got;\r\n  Our pains don't linger in one spot--\r\n  They skip about; the seesaw's end\r\n  That's up will mighty soon descend;\r\n  You've looked at bacon? Life's like that--\r\n  A streak of lean, a streak of fat.\r\n  Change, like a sky that clouds, that clears,\r\n  Hangs o'er the rectifying years.\r\n\r\n  Uneven things not leveled down\r\n  Are somehow simply got aroun';\r\n  The sting is taken from offence;\r\n  The evil has its recompense;\r\n  The broken heart is knit again;\r\n  The baffled longing knows not pain;\r\n  Wrong fades and trouble disappears\r\n  Before the rectifying years.\r\n\r\n  Then envy, hate towards man or class\r\n  Should from your sinful nature pass.\r\n  Though others hold a higher place\r\n  Or have more power or wealth or grace,\r\n  The best of them, be sure, cannot\r\n  Escape the common human lot;\r\n  So many smiles, so many tears\r\n  Come with the rectifying years.\r\n\r\n\r\n_St. Clair Adams._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THOSE WHO FAIL\r\n\r\n\r\nWe too often praise the man who wins just because he wins; the plaudits\r\nand laurels of victory are the unthinking crowd's means of estimating\r\nsuccess. But the vanquished may have fought more nobly than the victor;\r\nhe may have done his best against hopeless odds. As Addison makes Cato\r\nsay,\r\n\r\n  \"'Tis not in mortals to command success,\r\n  But we'll do more, Sempronius,--we'll deserve it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"All honor to him who shall win the prize,\"\r\n  The world has cried for a thousand years;\r\n  But to him who tries, and who fails and dies,\r\n  I give great honor and glory and tears;\r\n\r\n    Give glory and honor and pitiful tears\r\n  To all who fail in their deeds sublime;\r\n  Their ghosts are many in the van of years,\r\n  They were born with Time, in advance of Time.\r\n\r\n    Oh, great is the hero who wins a name,\r\n  But greater many and many a time\r\n  Some pale-faced fellow who dies in shame,\r\n  And lets God finish the thoughts sublime.\r\n\r\n    And great is the man with a sword undrawn,\r\n  And good is the man who refrains from wine;\r\n  But the man who fails and yet still fights on,\r\n  Lo, he is the twin-born brother of mine.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Joaquin Miller._\r\n\r\nFrom \"Joaquin Miller's Complete Poems.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHELPING' OUT\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I always look out for Number One,\" was the favorite remark of a man who\r\nthought he had found the great rule to success, but he had only stated\r\nhis own doctrine of selfishness, and his life was never very successful.\r\nA man must be big to succeed, and selfishness is always cramping and\r\nnarrow.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Da's a lot of folks what preach all day\r\n    An' always pointing' out de way,\r\n  Dey say dat prayin' all de time\r\n    An' keepin' yo' heart all full of rhyme\r\n  Will lead yo' soul to heights above\r\n    Whah angels coo like a turtledove.\r\n  But I's des lookin' round, dat's me--\r\n    I's trustin' lots in what I see;\r\n  It 'pears to me da's lots to do\r\n    Befo' we pass dat heavenly blue.\r\n  I believes in prayin', preachin' about,\r\n    But believe a lot mo' in helpin' out.\r\n\r\n  I believes in 'ligin, it's mighty sweet,\r\n    But de kind dat gits in yo' hands and feet\r\n  An' makes

reaching the South Pole, was\r\nstruggling through the cold and storms back towards safety, the strength\r\nof Evans, one of the men, became exhausted. He had done his best--vainly.\r\nNow he did not wish to imperil his companions, already sorely tried. At\r\na halting-place, therefore, he left them and, staggering out into a\r\nblizzard, perished alone. It was a failure, yes; but was it not also\r\nmagnificent success?\r\n\r\n\r\n    Here's to the men who lose!\r\n  What though their work be e'er so nobly planned,\r\n    And watched with zealous care,\r\n  No glorious halo crowns their efforts grand,\r\n    Contempt is failure's share.\r\n\r\n    Here's to the men who lose!\r\n  If triumph's easy smile our struggles greet,\r\n    Courage is easy then;\r\n  The king is he who, after fierce defeat,\r\n    Can up and fight again.\r\n\r\n    Here's to the men who lose!\r\n  The ready plaudits of a fawning world\r\n    Ring sweet in victor's ears;\r\n  The vanquished's banners never are unfurled--\r\n    For them there sound no cheers.\r\n\r\n    Here's to the men who lose!\r\n  The touchstone of true worth is not success;\r\n    There is a higher test--\r\n  Though fate may darkly frown, onward to press,\r\n    And bravely do one's best.\r\n\r\n    Here's to the men who lose!\r\n  It is the vanquished's praises that I sing,\r\n    And this is the toast I choose:\r\n  \"A hard-fought failure is a noble thing;\r\n    Here's to the men who lose!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Anonymous._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIT MAY BE\r\n\r\n\r\nMany, many are the human

Kiser._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn life is necessarily much monotony, sameness. But our triumph may lie\r\nin putting richness and meaning into routine that apparently lacks them.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Forenoon and afternoon and night,--Forenoon,\r\n  And afternoon, and night,--Forenoon, and--what!\r\n  The empty song repeats itself. No more?\r\n  Yea, that is Life: make this forenoon sublime,\r\n  This afternoon a psalm, this night a prayer,\r\n  And Time is conquered, and thy crown is won.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Edward Rowland Sill._\r\n\r\nFrom \"Poems.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GRUMPY GUY\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen students came, full of ambition, to the great scientist Agassiz, he\r\ngave each a fish and told him to find out what he could about it. They\r\nwent to work and in a day or two were ready for their report. But\r\nAgassiz didn't come round. To kill time they went to work again,\r\nobserved, dissected, conjectured, and when at the end of a fortnight\r\nAgassiz finally appeared, they felt that their knowledge was really\r\nexhaustive. The master's brief comment was that they had made a fair\r\nbeginning, and again he left. They then fell to in earnest and after\r\nweeks and months of investigation declared that a fish was the most\r\nfascinating of studies. If our interest in life fails, it is not from\r\nmaterial to work on. No two leaves are alike, not two human beings are\r\nalike, and if we are discerning, the attraction of any one of them is\r\ninfinite.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Grumpy Guy was feeling blue; the Grumpy Guy was glum;\r\n  The Grumpy Guy with baleful eye took Misery for a chum.\r\n  He hailed misfortunes as his pals, and murmured, \"Let 'em come!\"\r\n\r\n  \"Oh, what's the blooming use?\" he yelped, his face an angry red,\r\n  \"When everything's been thought before and everything's been said?\r\n  And what's a Grumpy Guy to do except to go to bed?\r\n\r\n  \"And where's the joy the poets sing, the merriment and fun?\r\n  How can one start a thing that's new when everything's begun?--\r\n  When everything's been planned before and everything's been done?--\r\n\r\n  \"When everything's been dreamed before and everything's been sought?\r\n  When everything that ever ran has, so to speak, been caught?--\r\n  When every game's been played before and every battle fought?\"\r\n\r\n  I started him at solitaire, a fooling, piffling game.\r\n  He played it ninety-seven hours and failed to find it tame.\r\n  In all the times he dealt the cards no two games were the same.\r\n\r\n  He never tumbled to its tricks nor mastered all its curves.\r\n  He grunted, \"Well, this takes the cake, the pickles and preserves!\r\n  Its infinite variety is getting on my nerves.\"\r\n\r\n  \"Its infinite variety!\" I scoffed. \"Just fifty-two\r\n  Poor trifling bits of pasteboard!--their combinations few\r\n  Compared to what there is in man!--the poorest!--even you!\r\n\r\n  \"Variety! You'll never find in forty-seven decks\r\n  One tenth of the variety found in the gentler sex.\r\n  Card combinations are but frills to hang around their necks.\r\n\r\n  \"The sun won't rise to-morrow as it came to us to-day,\r\n  'Twill be older, we'll be older, and to Time this debt we pay.\r\n  For nothing can repeat itself, for nothing knows the way.\"\r\n\r\n  Then the Grumpy Guy was silent as a miser hoarding pelf.\r\n  He knew 'twas time to put his grouch away upon", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 158117, "end_char_idx": 162046, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}",

Struggle is everywhere; as\r\nKearny said at Fair Oaks, \"There is lovely fighting along the whole\r\nline.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n  I fight a battle every day\r\n    Against discouragement and fear;\r\n  Some foe stands always in my way,\r\n    The path ahead is never clear!\r\n  I must forever be on guard\r\n    Against the doubts that skulk along;\r\n  I get ahead by fighting hard,\r\n    But fighting keeps my spirit strong.\r\n\r\n  I hear the croakings of Despair,\r\n    The dark predictions of the weak;\r\n  I find myself pursued by Care,\r\n    No matter what the end I seek;\r\n  My victories are small and few,\r\n    It matters not how hard I strive;\r\n  Each day the fight begins anew,\r\n    But fighting keeps my hopes alive.\r\n\r\n  My dreams are spoiled by circumstance,\r\n    My plans are wrecked by Fate or Luck;\r\n  Some hour, perhaps, will bring my chance,\r\n    But that great hour has never struck;\r\n  My progress has been slow and hard,\r\n    I've had to climb and crawl and swim,\r\n  Fighting for every stubborn yard,\r\n    But I have kept in fighting trim.\r\n\r\n  I have to fight my doubts away,\r\n    And be on guard against my fears;\r\n  The feeble croaking of Dismay\r\n    Has been familiar through the years;\r\n  My dearest plans keep going wrong,\r\n    Events combine to thwart my will,\r\n  But fighting keeps my spirit strong,\r\n    And I am undefeated still!\r\n\r\n\r\n_S.E.

Since only\r\nthrough pain can we come into true and helpful sympathy with men, we\r\nshould not wish to escape it.\r\n\r\n\r\n  What if this year has given\r\n    Grief that some year must bring,\r\n  What if it hurt your joyous youth,\r\n    Crippled your laughter's wing?\r\n  You always knew it was coming,\r\n    Coming to all, to you,\r\n  They always said there was suffering--\r\n    Now it is done, come through.\r\n\r\n  Even if you have blundered,\r\n    Even if you have sinned,\r\n  Still is the steadfast arch of the sky\r\n    And the healing veil of the wind....\r\n  And after only a little,\r\n    A little of hurt and pain,\r\n  You shall have the web of your own old dreams\r\n    Wrapping your heart again.\r\n\r\n  Only your heart can pity\r\n    Now, where it laughed and passed,\r\n  Now you can bend to comfort men,\r\n    One with them all at last,\r\n  You shall have back your laughter,\r\n    You shall have back your song,\r\n  Only the world is your brother now,\r\n    Only your soul is strong!\r\n\r\n\r\n_Margaret Widdemer._\r\n\r\nFrom \"The Old Road to Paradise.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCAN'T\r\n\r\n\r\nA great, achieving soul will not clog itself with a cowardly thought or\r\na cowardly watchword. Cardinal Richelieu in Bulwer-Lytton's play\r\ndeclares:\r\n\r\n  \"In the lexicon of youth, which fate reserves\r\n  For a bright manhood, there is no such word\r\n  As

more harm here than slander and lies;\r\n  On it is many a strong spirit broken,\r\n    And with it many a good purpose dies.\r\n  It springs from the lips of the thoughtless each morning\r\n    And robs us of courage we need through the day:\r\n  It rings in our ears like a timely-sent warning\r\n    And laughs when we falter and fall by the way.\r\n\r\n  _Can't_ is the father of feeble endeavor,\r\n    The parent of terror and half-hearted work;\r\n  It weakens the efforts of artisans clever,", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 162000, "end_char_idx": 165865,

the word that is foe to ambition,\r\n    An enemy ambushed to shatter your will;\r\n  Its prey is forever the man with a mission\r\n    And bows but to courage and patience and skill.\r\n  Hate it, with hatred that's deep and undying,\r\n    For once it is welcomed 'twill break any man;\r\n  Whatever the goal you are seeking, keep trying\r\n    And answer this demon by saying: \"I _can_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Edgar A. Guest._\r\n\r\nFrom \"A Heap o' Livin'.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STRUGGLE\r\n\r\n\r\nWe all dream of being St. Georges and fighting dragons amid glamor and\r\nglory and the applause of the world. But our real fights are mostly\r\ncommonplace, routine battles, where no great victory is ours at the end\r\nof the day. To persist in them requires quiet strength and unfaltering\r\ncourage.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Did you ever want to take your two bare hands,\r\n    And choke out of the world your big success?\r\n  Beat, torn fists bleeding, pathways rugged, grand,\r\n    By sheer brute strength and bigness, nothing less?\r\n  So at the last, triumphant, battered, strong,\r\n    You might gaze down on what you choked and beat,\r\n  And say, \"Ah, world, you've wrought to do me wrong;\r\n    And thus have I accepted my defeat.\"\r\n\r\n  Have you ever dreamed of virile deeds, and vast,\r\n    And then come back from dreams with wobbly knees,\r\n  To find your way (the braver vision past),\r\n    By picking meekly at typewriter keys;\r\n  By bending o'er a ledger, day by day,\r\n    By some machine-like drudging? No great woe\r\n  To grapple with. Slow, painful is the way,\r\n    And still, the bravest fight and conquer so.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Miriam Teichner._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOLD FAST\r\n\r\n\r\nA football coach who told his players that their rivals were too strong\r\nfor them would be seeking a new position the next year. If the opposing\r\nteam is formidable, he says so; if his men have their work cut out for\r\nthem, he admits it; but he mentions these things as incitements to\r\neffort. Merely saying of victory that it can be won is among the surest\r\nways of winning it.\r\n\r\n\r\n  When you're nearly drowned in trouble, and the world is dark as ink;\r\n    When you feel yourself a-sinking 'neath the strain,\r\n  And you think, \"I've got to holler 'Help!'\" just take another breath\r\n    And pretend you've lost your voice--and can't complain!\r\n      (That's the idea!)\r\n    Pretend you've lost your voice and can't complain!\r\n\r\n  When the future glowers at you like a threatening thunder cloud,\r\n    Just grit your teeth and bend your head and say:\r\n  \"It's dark and disagreeable and I can't help feeling blue,\r\n    But there's coming sure as fate a brighter day!\"\r\n      (Say it slowly!)\r\n    \"But there's coming sure as fate, a brighter day!\"\r\n\r\n  You have bluffed your way through ticklish situations; that I know.\r\n    You are looking back on troubles past and gone;\r\n  Now, turn the tables, and as you have fought and won before,\r\n    Just BLUFF YOURSELF to keep on holding on!\r\n      (Try it once.)\r\n  Just bluff YOURSELF to keep on--holding on.\r\n\r\n  Don't worry if the roseate hues of life are faded out,\r\n    Bend low before the storm and wait awhile.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 165790, "end_char_idx": 169580, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}",

Admire him or not, we\r\nmust at least praise his pluck in holding to his purpose--a purpose he\r\nultimately attained.\r\n\r\n\r\n  You will be what you will to be;\r\n    Let failure find its false content\r\n  In that poor word \"environment,\"\r\n    But spirit scorns it, and is free.\r\n\r\n  It masters time, it conquers space,\r\n    It cowes that boastful trickster Chance,\r\n  And bids the tyrant Circumstance\r\n    Uncrown and fill a servant's place.\r\n\r\n  The human Will, that force unseen,\r\n    The offspring of a deathless Soul,\r\n  Can hew the way to any goal,\r\n    Though walls of granite intervene.\r\n\r\n  Be not impatient in delay,\r\n    But wait as one who understands;\r\n  When spirit rises and commands\r\n    The gods are ready to obey.\r\n\r\n  The river seeking for the sea\r\n    Confronts the dam and precipice,\r\n  Yet knows it cannot fail or miss;\r\n    _You will be what you will to be!_\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ella Wheeler Wilcox._\r\n\r\nFrom \"Poems of Power.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GAME\r\n\r\n\r\nLessing said that if God should come to him with truth in one hand and\r\nthe never-ending pursuit of truth in the other, and should offer him his\r\nchoice, he would humbly and reverently take the pursuit of truth.\r\nPerhaps it is best that finite beings should not attain infinite\r\nsuccess. But however remote that for which they seek or strive, they may\r\nby their diligence and generosity make the very effort to secure it\r\nnoble. In doing this they earn, as Pope tells us, a truer commendation\r\nthan success itself could bring them. \"Act well thy part; there all the\r\nhonor lies.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n  Let's play it out--this little game called Life,\r\n    Where we are listed for so brief a spell;\r\n  Not just to win, amid the tumult rife,\r\n    Or where acclaim and gay applauses swell;\r\n  Nor just to conquer where some one must lose,\r\n    Or reach the goal whatever be the cost;\r\n  For there are other, better ways to choose,\r\n    Though in the end the battle may be lost.\r\n\r\n  Let's play it out as if it were a sport\r\n    Wherein the game is better than the goal,\r\n  And never mind the detailed \"score's\" report\r\n    Of errors made, if each with dauntless soul\r\n  But stick it out until the day is done,\r\n    Not wasting fairness for success or fame,\r\n  So when the battle has been lost or won,\r\n    The world at least can say: \"He played the game.\"\r\n\r\n  Let's play it out--this little game called Work,\r\n    Or War or Love or what part each may draw;\r\n  Play like a man who scorns to quit or shirk\r\n    Because the break may carry some deep flaw;\r\n  Nor simply holding that the goal is all\r\n    That keeps the player in the contest staying;\r\n  But stick it out from curtain rise to fall,\r\n    As if the game itself were worth the playing.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Grantland Rice._\r\n\r\nFrom \"The Sportlight.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOURAGE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe philosopher Kant held himself to his habits so precisely that people\r\nset their watches by him as he took his daily walk. We may be equally\r\nconstant amid worldly vicissitudes, but only a man of true courage is.\r\n\r\n\r\n  'Tis the front towards life that matters most--\r\n    The tone, the point of view,\r\n  The constancy that in defeat\r\n    Remains untouched and true;\r\n\r\n  For death in patriot fight may be\r\n    Less gallant than a smile,\r\n  And high endeavor, to the gods,\r\n    Seems in itself worth while!\r\n\r\n\r\n_Florence Earle Coates._\r\n\r\nFrom \"Poems.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA GOOD NAME\r\n\r\n\r\nWe should respect the good name of other people, and should", "mimetype":

Lee replied that\r\nwhile he wished to earn his living, he doubted whether his services\r\nwould be worth so large a sum. \"We don't want your services,\" the man\r\ninterrupted; \"we want your name.\" \"That,\" said Lee, quietly, \"is not for\r\nsale.\" He accepted, instead, the presidency of a college at $1500 a\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Good name in man and woman, dear my lord,\r\n  Is the immediate jewel of their souls:\r\n  Who steals my purse steals trash; 'tis something, nothing;\r\n  'Twas mine, 'tis his, and has been slave to thousands;\r\n  But he that filches from me my good name\r\n  Robs me of that which not enriches him,\r\n  And makes me poor indeed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_William Shakespeare._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSWELLITIS\r\n\r\n\r\nA certain employer of large numbers of men makes it a principle to\r\npraise none of them, not because they are undeserving, and not because\r\nhe dislikes to commend, but because experience has taught him that\r\nusually the praise goes to the head of the recipient, both impairing his\r\nwork and making it harder for others to associate with him. A good test\r\nof a man is his way of taking commendation. He may, even while grateful,\r\nbe stirred to humility that he has not done better still, and may\r\nresolve to accomplish more. Or imitating the frog who wished to look\r\nlike an ox, he may swell and swell until--figuratively speaking--he\r\nbursts.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Somebody said he'd done it well,\r\n  And presto! his head began to swell;\r\n  Bigger and bigger the poor thing grew--\r\n  A wonder it didn't split in two.\r\n  In size a balloon could scarcely match it;\r\n  He needed a fishing-pole to scratch it;---\r\n  But six and a half was the size of his hat,\r\n  And it rattled around on his head at that!\r\n\r\n  \"Good work,\" somebody chanced to say,\r\n  And his chest swelled big as a load of hay.\r\n  About himself, like a rooster, he crowed;\r\n  Of his wonderful work he bragged and blowed\r\n  He marched around with a peacock strut;\r\n  Gigantic to him was the figure he cut;--\r\n  But he wore a very small-sized suit,\r\n  And loosely it hung on him, to boot!\r\n\r\n  HE was the chap who made things hum!\r\n  HE was the drumstick and the drum!\r\n  HE was the shirt bosom and the starch!\r\n  HE was the keystone in the arch!\r\n  HE was the axis of the earth!\r\n  Nothing existed before his birth!\r\n  But when he was off from work a\r\n  Nobody knew that he was away!\r\n\r\n  This is a fact that is sad to tell:\r\n  It's the empty head that is bound to swell;\r\n  It's the light-weight fellow who soars to the skies\r\n  And bursts like a bubble before your eyes.\r\n  A big man is humbled by honest praise,\r\n  And tries to think of all the ways\r\n  To improve his work and do it well;--\r\n  But a little man starts of himself to yell!\r\n\r\n\r\n_Joseph Morris:_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCARES\r\n\r\n\r\nTo those who are wearied, fretted, and worried there is no physician\r\nlike nature. When our nerves are frazzled and our sleep is unrefreshing,\r\nwe can find no better antidote to the clamorous grind and frenzy of the\r\ncity than the stillness and solitude of hills, streams, and tranquil\r\nstars. That man lays up for himself resources of strength who now and\r\nthen exchanges the ledger for green leaves, the factory for wild\r\nflowers, business for brook-croon and bird-song.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The little cares that fretted me,\r\n    I lost them yesterday\r\n  Among the fields above the sea,\r\n    Among the winds at play;\r\n  Among the lowing of the herds,\r\n    The rustling of the trees,\r\n  Among the singing of the birds,\r\n    The humming of the bees.\r\n\r\n  The foolish fears of what may happen,\r\n    I cast them all away\r\n  Among the clover-scented grass,\r\n    Among the new-mown hay;\r\n  Among the husking of the corn\r\n    Where drowsy poppies nod,\r\n  Where ill thoughts die and good are born\r\n    Out in the fields with", "mimetype": "text/plain",

beginning on opposite sides of a mountain met in\r\nthe middle--and all this visualized and thought out before the actual\r\nwork was begun. Faith has such foresight, such courage, whether it toils\r\nactively or can merely bide its time.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The tree-top, high above the barren field,\r\n    Rising beyond the night's gray folds of mist,\r\n  Rests stirless where the upper air is sealed\r\n    To perfect silence, by the faint moon kissed.\r\n  But the low branches, drooping to the ground,\r\n    Sway to and fro, as sways funereal plume,\r\n  While from their restless depths low whispers sound:\r\n    \"We fear, we fear the darkness and the gloom;\r\n    Dim forms beneath us pass and reappear,\r\n    And mournful tongues are menacing us here.\"\r\n\r\n  Then from the topmost bough falls calm reply:\r\n    \"Hush, hush, I see the coming of the morn;\r\n  Swiftly the silent night is passing by,\r\n    And in her bosom rosy Dawn is borne.\r\n    'Tis but your own dim shadows that ye see,\r\n    'Tis but your own low moans that trouble ye.\"\r\n\r\n  So Life stands, with a twilight world around;\r\n    Faith turned serenely to the steadfast sky,\r\n  Still answering the heart that sweeps the ground\r\n    Sobbing in fear, and tossing restlessly--\r\n    \"Hush, hush! The Dawn breaks o'er the Eastern sea,\r\n    'Tis but thine own dim shadow troubling thee.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Edward Rowland Sill._\r\n\r\nFrom \"Poems.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPLAYING THE GAME\r\n\r\n\r\nWe all like the good sport--the man who plays fair and courteously and\r\nwith every ounce of his energy, even when the game is going against him.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Life is a game with a glorious prize,\r\n    If we can only play it right.\r\n  It is give and take, build and break,\r\n    And often it ends in a fight;\r\n  But he surely wins who honestly tries\r\n    (Regardless of wealth or fame),\r\n  He can never despair who plays it fair--\r\n    How are you playing the game?\r\n\r\n  Do you wilt and whine, if you fail to win\r\n    In the manner you think your due?\r\n  Do you sneer at the man in case that he can\r\n    And does, do better than you?\r\n  Do you take your rebuffs with a knowing grin?\r\n    Do you laugh tho' you pull up lame?\r\n  Does your faith hold true when the whole world's blue?\r\n    How are you playing the game?\r\n\r\n  Get into the thick of it--wade in, boys!\r\n    Whatever your cherished goal;\r\n  Brace up your will till your pulses thrill,\r\n    And you dare--to your very soul!\r\n  Do something more than make a noise;\r\n    Let your purpose leap into flame\r\n  As you plunge with a cry, \"I shall do or die,\"\r\n    Then you will be playing the game.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Anonymous_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT DARK DAYS DO\r\n\r\n\r\nA real man does not want all his barriers leveled. He of course welcomes\r\neasy tasks, but he welcomes hard ones also. The difficult or unpleasant\r\nthing puts him on his mettle, throws him on his own resources. It gives\r\nhim something of\r\n\r\n  \"The stern joy which warriors feel\r\n  In foemen worthy of their steel.\"\r\n\r\nMoreover as a foil or contrast it enables him to value more truly the\r\ngood things he constantly enjoys, perhaps without perceiving them.\r\n\r\n\r\n  I sorter like a gloomy day,\r\n    Th' kind that jest _won't_ smile;\r\n  It makes a feller hump hisself\r\n    T' make life seem wuth while.\r\n  When sun's a-shinin' an' th' sky\r\n    Is washed out bright an' gay,\r\n  It ain't no job to whistle--but\r\n    It is--\r\n      When skies air gray!\r\n\r\n  So gloomy days air good fer us,\r\n    They make us look about\r\n  To find our", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 177321, "end_char_idx": 181162, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}",

He carries his own\r\nlight.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The world has brought not anything\r\n    To make me glad to-day!\r\n  The swallow had a broken wing,\r\n  And after all my journeying\r\n  There was no water in the spring--\r\n    My friend has said me nay.\r\n  But yet somehow I needs must sing\r\n    As on a luckier day.\r\n\r\n  Dusk fails as gray as any tear,\r\n    There is no hope in sight!\r\n  But something in me seems so fair,\r\n  That like a star I needs must wear\r\n  A safety made of shining air\r\n    Between me and the night.\r\n  Such inner weavings do I wear\r\n    All fashioned of delight!\r\n\r\n  I need not for these robes of mine\r\n    The loveliness of earth,\r\n  But happenings remote and fine\r\n  Like threads of dreams will blow and shine\r\n  In gossamer and crystalline,\r\n    And I was glad from birth.\r\n  So even while my eyes repine,\r\n    My heart is clothed in mirth.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Anna Hempstead Branch._\r\n\r\nFrom \"The Shoes That Danced, and Other Poems.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIT WON'T STAY BLOWED\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is easier to fail than succeed. It is easier to drift downstream than\r\nup. But just as pent steam finds an escape somewhere, so will the man\r\nwho persists break at one point or another through confining\r\ncircumstance.\r\n\r\n\r\n  To the sniffing pickaninny once his good old mammy said,\r\n  \"Yo' lil' black nose am drippin' from de cold dat's in yo' head,\r\n  An' yo' sleeve am slick and shiny like de hillside when it snows.\r\n  Why doan' you pump de bellers from de

Adams._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RAINBOW\r\n\r\n\r\nOur lives are not a hodge-podge of separate experiences, though they\r\nsometimes seem so. They are held together by simple things which we\r\nbehold again and again with the same emotions. Thus the man is what the\r\nboy has been; the tree is inclined in the precise direction the twig was\r\nbent.\r\n\r\n\r\n  My heart leaps up when I behold\r\n  A rainbow in the sky:\r\n  So was it when my life began;\r\n  So is it now I am a man;\r\n  So be it when I shall grow old,\r\n    Or let me die!\r\n  The Child is father of the Man;\r\n  And I could wish my days to be\r\n  Bound each to each by natural piety.\r\n\r\n\r\n_William Wordsworth._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIRM OF GRIN AND BARRETT\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been said that when disaster overtakes us, we can do one of two\r\nthings--we can grin and bear it, or we needn't grin. The spirit that\r\nkeeps a smile on our faces when our burden is heaviest is the spirit\r\nthat will win in the long run. Many men know how to take success\r\nquietly. The real test of a man is he way he takes failure.\r\n\r\n\r\n  No financial throe volcanic\r\n    Ever yet was known to scare it;\r\n  Never yet was any panic\r\n    Scared the firm of Grin and Barrett.\r\n  From the flurry and the fluster,\r\n    From the ruin and the crashes,\r\n  They arise in brighter lustre,\r\n    Like the phoenix from his ashes.\r\n  When the banks and corporations\r\n    Quake with fear, they do not share it;\r\n  Smiling through all perturbations\r\n    Goes the firm of Grin and Barrett.\r\n        Grin and Barrett,\r\n        Who can scare it?\r\n    Scare the firm of Grin and Barrett?\r\n\r\n  When the tide-sweep of reverses\r\n    Smites them, firm they stand and dare it\r\n  Without wailings, tears, or curses,\r\n    This stout firm of Grin and Barrett.\r\n  Even should their house go under\r\n    In the flood and inundation,\r\n  Calm they stand amid the thunder\r\n    Without noise or demonstration.\r\n  And, when sackcloth is the fashion,\r\n    With a patient smile they wear it,\r\n  Without petulance or passion,\r\n    This old firm of Grin and Barrett.\r\n        Grin and Barrett,\r\n        Who can scare it?\r\n    Scare the firm of Grin and Barrett?\r\n\r\n  When the other firms show dizziness,\r\n    Here's a house that does not share it.\r\n  Wouldn't you like to join the business?\r\n    Join the firm of Grin and Barrett?\r\n  Give your strength that does not murmur,\r\n    And your nerve that does not falter,\r\n  And you've joined a house that's firmer\r\n    Than the old rock of Gibraltar.\r\n

A battle may be lost, but the\r\ncampaign won; a campaign lost, but the war won.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Life, I challenge you to try me,\r\n    Doom me to unending pain;\r\n  Stay my hand, becloud my vision,\r\n    Break my heart and then--again.\r\n\r\n  Shatter every dream I've cherished,\r\n    Fill my heart with ruthless fear;\r\n  Follow every smile that cheers me\r\n    With a bitter, blinding tear.\r\n\r\n  Thus I dare you; you can try me,\r\n    Seek to make me cringe and moan,\r\n  Still my unbound soul defies you,\r\n    I'll withstand you--and, alone!\r\n\r\n\r\n_Jean Nette._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYOUR MISSION\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most often-heard of sentences is \"I don't know what I'm to do\r\nin the world.\" Yet very few people are ever for a moment out of\r\nsomething to do, especially if they do not insist on climbing to the top\r\nof the pole and waving the flag, but are willing to steady the pole\r\nwhile somebody else climbs.\r\n\r\n\r\n  If you cannot on the ocean\r\n    Sail among the swiftest fleet,\r\n  Rocking on the highest billows,\r\n    Laughing at the storms you meet;\r\n  You can stand among the sailors,\r\n    Anchored yet within the bay,\r\n  You can lend a hand to help them\r\n    As they launch their boats away.\r\n\r\n  If you are too weak to journey\r\n    Up the mountain, steep and high,\r\n  You can stand within the valley\r\n    While the multitudes go by;\r\n  You can chant in happy measure\r\n    As they slowly pass along--\r\n  Though they may forget the singer,\r\n    They will not forget the song.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  If you cannot in the harvest\r\n    Garner up the richest sheaves,\r\n  Many a grain, both ripe and golden,\r\n    Oft the careless reaper leaves;\r\n  Go and glean among the briars\r\n    Growing rank against the wall,\r\n  For it may be that their shadow\r\n    Hides the heaviest grain of all.\r\n\r\n  If you cannot in the conflict\r\n    Prove yourself a soldier true;\r\n  If, where fire and smoke are thickest,\r\n    There's no work for you to do;\r\n  When the battle field is silent,\r\n    You can go with careful tread;\r\n  You can bear away the wounded,\r\n    You can cover up the dead.\r\n\r\n  Do not then stand idly waiting\r\n    For some greater work to do;\r\n  Fortune is a lazy goddess,\r\n    She will never come to you;\r\n  Go and toil in any vineyard,\r\n    Do not fear to do and dare.\r\n  If you want a field of labor\r\n    You can find it anywhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ellen M.H. Gates._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVICTORY\r\n\r\n\r\nTo fail is not a disgrace; the disgrace lies in not trying. In his old\r\nage Sir Walter Scott found that a publishing firm he was connected with\r\nwas heavily in debt. He refused to take advantage of the bankruptcy law,\r\nand sat down with his pen to make good the deficit. Though he wore out\r\nhis life in the struggle and did not live to see the debt entirely\r\nliquidated, he died an honored and honorable man.\r\n\r\n\r\n  I call no fight a losing fight\r\n  If, fighting, I have gained some straight new strength;\r\n  If, fighting, I turned ever toward the light,\r\n  All unallied with forces of the night;\r\n  If, beaten, quivering, I could say at length:\r\n  \"I did no deed that needs to be unnamed;\r\n  I fought--and lost--and I am", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 187310, "end_char_idx": 190991, "text_template":

We must not grow too downcast from failure, for life\r\nis not all failure.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The lopped tree in time may grow again,\r\n    Most naked plants renew both fruit and flower;\r\n  The sorriest wight may find release of pain,\r\n    The driest soil suck in some moistening shower;\r\n  Time goes by turns, and chances change by course,\r\n    From foul to fair, from better hap to worse.\r\n\r\n  The sea of Fortune doth not ever flow;\r\n    She draws her favors to the lowest ebb;\r\n  Her tides have equal times to come and go;\r\n    Her loom doth weave the fine and coarsest web;\r\n  No joy so great but runneth to an end,\r\n    No hap so hard but may in fine amend.\r\n\r\n  Not always fall of leaf, nor ever Spring;\r\n    Not endless night, yet not eternal day;\r\n  The saddest birds a season find to sing;\r\n    The roughest storm a calm may soon allay.\r\n  Thus, with succeeding turns God tempereth all,\r\n    That man may hope to rise, yet fear to fall.\r\n\r\n  A chance may win that by mischance was lost;\r\n    That net that holds no great takes little fish;\r\n  In some things all, in all things none are crost;\r\n    Few all they need, but none have all they wish.\r\n  Unmingled joys here to no man befall;\r\n    Who least, hath some; who most, hath never all.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Robert Southwell._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO-DAY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe past did not behold to-day; the future shall not. We must use it now\r\nif it is to be of any benefit to mankind.\r\n\r\n\r\n  So here hath been dawning\r\n    Another blue day;\r\n  Think, wilt thou let it\r\n    Slip useless away?\r\n\r\n  Out of Eternity\r\n    This new day is born;\r\n  Into Eternity,\r\n    At night will return.\r\n\r\n  Behold it aforetime\r\n    No eye ever did;\r\n  So soon it for ever\r\n    From all eyes is hid.\r\n\r\n  Here hath been dawning\r\n    Another blue day;\r\n  Think, wilt thou let it\r\n    Slip useless away?\r\n\r\n\r\n_Thomas Carlyle._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNAFRAID\r\n\r\n\r\n  I have no fear. What is in store for me\r\n    Shall find me ready for it, undismayed.\r\n  God grant my only cowardice may be\r\n    Afraid--to be afraid!\r\n\r\n\r\n_Everard Jack Appleton._\r\n\r\nFrom \"The Quiet Courage.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBORROWED FEATHERS\r\n\r\n\r\nMany good, attractive people spoil the merits they have by trying to be\r\nsomething bigger or showier. It is always best to be one's self.\r\n\r\n\r\n  A rooster one morning was preening his feathers\r\n    That glistened so bright in the sun;\r\n  He admired the tints of the various colors\r\n    As he laid them in place one by one.\r\n  Now as roosters go he was a fine bird,\r\n    And he should have been satisfied;\r\n  But suddenly there as he marched along,\r\n    Some peacock feathers he spied.\r\n  They had beautiful spots and their colors were gay--\r\n    He wished that his own could be green;\r\n  He dropped his tail, tried to hide it away;\r\n    Was completely ashamed to be seen.\r\n\r\n  Then his foolish mind hatched up a scheme--\r\n    A peacock yet he could be;\r\n  So he hopped behind a bush to undress\r\n    Where the other fowls could not see.\r\n  He caught his own tail between his bill,\r\n    And pulled every feather out;\r\n  And into the holes stuck the peacock plumes;\r\n    Then proudly strutted about.\r\n  The other fowls rushed to see the queer sight;\r\n    And the peacocks came when they heard;\r\n  They could not agree just what he was,\r\n    But pronounced him a funny bird.\r\n\r\n  Then the chickens were angry that one of their kind\r\n    Should try to be a peacock;\r\n  And the", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 190934, "end_char_idx": 194651, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template":

ON\r\n\r\n\r\nThe author of these homely stanzas has caught perfectly the spirit which\r\nsucceeds in the rough-and-tumble of actual life.\r\n\r\n\r\n  If the day looks kinder gloomy\r\n  And your chances kinder slim,\r\n  If the situation's puzzlin'\r\n  And the prospect's awful grim,\r\n  If perplexities keep pressin'\r\n  Till hope is nearly gone,\r\n  Just bristle up and grit your teeth\r\n  And keep on keepin' on.\r\n\r\n  Frettin' never wins a fight\r\n  And fumin' never pays;\r\n  There ain't no use in broodin'\r\n  In these pessimistic ways;\r\n  Smile just kinder cheerfully\r\n  Though hope is nearly gone,\r\n  And bristle up and grit your teeth\r\n  And keep on keepin' on.\r\n\r\n  There ain't no use in growlin'\r\n  And grumblin' all the time,\r\n  When music's ringin' everywhere\r\n  And everything's a rhyme.\r\n  Just keep on smilin' cheerfully\r\n  If hope is nearly gone,\r\n  And bristle up and grit your teeth\r\n  And keep on keepin' on.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Anonymous._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DISAPPOINTED\r\n\r\n\r\nThose who have striven nobly and failed deserve sympathy. Sometimes they\r\ndeserve also praise unreserved, in that they have refused to do\r\nsomething ignoble which would have led to what the world calls success.\r\nThey have lived the idea which Macbeth merely proclaimed:\r\n\r\n  \"I dare do all that may become a man;\r\n  Who dares do more is none.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n  There are songs enough for the hero\r\n    Who dwells on the heights of fame;\r\n  I sing of the disappointed--\r\n    For those who have missed their aim.\r\n\r\n  I sing with a tearful cadence\r\n    For one who stands in the dark,\r\n  And knows that his last, best arrow\r\n    Has bounded back from the mark.\r\n\r\n  I sing for the breathless runner,\r\n    The eager, anxious soul,\r\n  Who falls with his strength exhausted.\r\n    Almost in sight of the goal;\r\n\r\n  For the hearts that break in silence,\r\n    With a sorrow all unknown,\r\n  For those who need companions,\r\n    Yet walk their ways alone.\r\n\r\n  There are songs enough for the lovers\r\n    Who share love's tender pain,\r\n  I sing for the one whose passion\r\n    Is given all in vain.\r\n\r\n  For those whose spirit comrades\r\n    Have missed them on their way,\r\n  I sing, with a heart o'erflowing,\r\n    This minor strain to-day.\r\n\r\n  And I know the Solar system\r\n    Must somewhere keep in space\r\n  A prize for that spent runner\r\n    Who barely lost the race.\r\n\r\n  For the plan would be imperfect\r\n    Unless it held some sphere\r\n  That paid for the toil and talent\r\n    And love that are wasted here.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ella Wheeler Wilcox._\r\n\r\nFrom \"Picked Poems.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLET ME LIVE OUT MY YEARS\r\n\r\n\r\nWe speak of the comforts and ease of old age, but our noblest selves do\r\nnot really desire them. We want to do more than exist. We want to be\r\nalive to the very last.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Let me live out my years in heat of blood!\r\n  Let me die drunken with the dreamer's wine!\r\n  Let me not see this soul-house built of mud\r\n  Go toppling to the dust--a vacant shrine!\r\n\r\n  Let me go quickly like a candle light\r\n  Snuffed out just at the heyday of its glow!\r\n  Give me high noon--and let it then be night!\r\n      Thus would I go.\r\n\r\n  And grant that when I face the grisly Thing,\r\n  My song may triumph down the gray Perhaps!\r\n  Let me be as a tuneswept fiddlestring\r\n  That feels the Master Melody--and snaps.\r\n\r\n\r\n_John G.

To the terrors of an\r\nunknown sea and the mutinous dismay of the sailors Columbus has but two\r\nthings to oppose--his faith and his unflinching will. But these suffice,\r\nas they always do. In the last four lines of the poem is a lesson for\r\nour nation to-day. The seas upon which our ideals have launched us are\r\nperilous and uncharted. In some ways our whole voyage of democracy seems\r\nfutile. Shall we turn back, or shall we, like Columbus, answer the\r\nfalterers in words that leap like a leaping sword; \"Sail on, sail on\"?\r\n\r\n\r\n    Behind him lay the gray Azores,\r\n  Behind the Gates of Hercules;\r\n  Before him not the ghost of shores:\r\n  Before him only shoreless seas.\r\n  The good mate said: \"Now must we pray,\r\n  For lo! the very stars are gone.\r\n  Brave Adm'r'l, speak; what shall I say?\"\r\n  \"Why, say: 'Sail on! sail on! and on!'\"\r\n\r\n    \"My men grow mutinous day by day;\r\n  My men grow ghastly wan and weak.\"\r\n  The stout mate thought of home; a spray\r\n  Of salt wave washed his swarthy cheek.\r\n  \"What shall I say, brave Adm'r'l, say,\r\n  If we sight naught but seas at dawn?\"\r\n  \"Why, you shall say at break of day:\r\n  'Sail on! sail on! sail on! and on!'\"\r\n\r\n    They sailed and sailed, as winds might blow;\r\n  Until at last the blanched mate said:\r\n  \"Why, now not even God would know\r\n  Should I and all my men fall dead.\r\n  These very winds forget their way,\r\n  For God from these dread seas is gone.\r\n  Now speak, brave Adm'r'l; speak and say--\"\r\n  He said: \"Sail on! sail on! and on!\"\r\n\r\n    They sailed. They sailed. Then spake the mate:\r\n  \"This mad sea shows his teeth to-night.\r\n  He curls his lip, he lies in wait,\r\n  With lifted teeth, as if to bite!\r\n  Brave Adm'r'l, say but one good word:\r\n  What shall we do when hope is gone?\"\r\n  The words leapt like a leaping sword:\r\n  \"Sail on! sail on! sail on! and on!\"\r\n\r\n  Then, pale and worn, he kept his deck,\r\n  And peered through darkness. Ah, that night\r\n  Of all dark nights! And then a speck--\r\n  It grew, a starlit flag unfurled!\r\n  It grew to be Time's burst of dawn.\r\n  He gained a world; he gave that world\r\n  Its grandest lesson: \"On! sail on!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Joaquin Miller._\r\n\r\nFrom \"Joaquin Miller's Complete Poems.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPER ASPERA\r\n\r\nA motto has been made of the Latin phrase \"per aspera ad astra,\" of\r\nwhich the translation sometimes given is \"through bolts and bars to the\r\nstars.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n  Thank God, a man can grow!\r\n  He is not bound\r\n  With earthward gaze to creep along the ground:\r\n  Though his beginnings be but poor and low,\r\n  Thank God, a man can grow!\r\n  The fire upon his altars may burn dim,\r\n    The torch he lighted may in darkness fail,\r\n    And nothing to rekindle it avail,--\r\n  Yet high beyond his dull horizon's rim,\r\n  Arcturus and the Pleiads beckon him.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Florence Earle Coates._\r\n\r\nFrom \"Poems.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTIT FOR TAT\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are quick to notice obstacles, grudges, affronts. Are we equally\r\nquick to recognize the kindly influences that speed us on our way? The\r\ntruth is we are each of us a debtor to life, and as honest men we should\r\ndo all we can to discharge the obligation.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Life,\" you say, \"'s an old curmudgeon; yes, a thing whose heart is\r\n            flint;\r\n  When I ask a friendly greeting, all I get's an angry glint.\r\n  Let me do it every good turn that I can--my very best,\r\n  Still it strikes me, trips, maligns me, and denies my least request.\r\n\r\n        \"So,\" you say, \"my patience ended, I will give it tit for tat.\"", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 198392, "end_char_idx":

Say,\r\n  Make a little inventory of its gifts to you to-day.\r\n  You've a house or room to sleep in--did you build it with your hand?\r\n  If you did, who made the hammer and who cleared for you the land?\r\n\r\n        And electric lights--you use them; did you also put them there?\r\n      Beefsteak, coal, your mail, shoes, street cars--do they come like\r\n                rain from air?\r\n      Or do countless men, far-scattered, toil that you may have more\r\n                ease?--\r\n      Stokers, hodmen, farmers, plumbers, Yankees, dagoes, Japanese?\r\n\r\n    \"Oh, that's general,\" you tell me. You have private blessings too.\r\n  Why, your mother in your childhood slaved and wrought and lived for you.\r\n  Helpful hands were all around you--hopes, fond wishes in the past;\r\n  Even now each day from somewhere friendly looks are on you cast.\r\n\r\n        Though you've been both crossed and harried, you've not struggled\r\n                on alone;\r\n      Through the discords of endeavor comes to you an answering tone.\r\n      Life has done you many favors. Will you give it tit for tat?\r\n      Since you've looked so much at this side, won't you have a look\r\n                at that?\r\n\r\n    Don't help only those who've helped you, count the rest as strangers,\r\n            foes;\r\n  How long now would you have lasted had all done as you propose?\r\n  Many and many a benefactor you did not nor can repay--\r\n  There's your mother. Pass the kindness on to others--that's the way.\r\n\r\n        Life it is that's given freely. Unto life make due return.\r\n      Whether folks are undeserving, neither seek nor wish to learn.\r\n      Hit your dernedest for your teammates every time you come to bat,\r\n      And the world will be more happy that you give it tit for tat.\r\n\r\n\r\n_St. Clair Adams._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE KINGDOM OF MAN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe wisest men know that the greatest world is not outside them. They\r\ncould, in Shakespeare's phrase, be bounded by a nut-shell and count\r\nthemselves kings of infinite space.\r\n\r\n\r\n  What of the outer drear,\r\n    As long as there's inner light;\r\n  As long as the sun of cheer\r\n    Shines ardently bright?\r\n\r\n  As long as the soul's a-wing,\r\n    As long as the heart is true,\r\n  What power hath trouble to bring\r\n    A sorrow to you?\r\n\r\n  No bar can encage the soul,\r\n    Nor capture the spirit free,\r\n  As long as old earth shall roll,\r\n    Or hours shall be.\r\n\r\n  Our world is the world within,\r\n    Our life is the thought we take,\r\n  And never an outer sin\r\n    Can mar it or break.\r\n\r\n  Brood not on the rich man's land,\r\n    Sigh not for miser's gold,\r\n  Holding in reach of your hand\r\n    The treasure untold\r\n\r\n  That lies in the Mines of Heart,\r\n    That rests in the soul alone--\r\n  Bid worry and care depart,\r\n    Come into your own!\r\n\r\n\r\n_John Kendrick_\r\n\r\nFrom \"Songs of Cheer.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nABOU BEN ADHEM\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Forgive my enemies?\" said the dying man to the priest. \"I have none.\r\nI've killed them all.\" This old ideal of exterminating our enemies has\r\nby no means disappeared from the earth. But it is waning. \"Live and let\r\nlive\" is a more modern slogan, which mounts in turn from mere\r\ntoleration of other people to a spirit of service and universal\r\nbrotherhood.

Love of our fellow men--has humanity reached any height\r\nsuperior to this?\r\n\r\n\r\n  Abou Ben Adhem (may his tribe increase!)\r\n  Awoke one night from a deep dream of peace,\r\n  And saw, within the moonlight in his room,\r\n  Making it rich, and like a lily in bloom,\r\n  An angel writing in a book of gold:--\r\n  Exceeding peace had made Ben Adhem bold,\r\n  And to the presence in the room he said,\r\n  \"What writest thou?\"--The vision raised its head,\r\n  And with a look made of all sweet accord,\r\n  Answered, \"The names of those who love the Lord.\"\r\n  \"And is mine one?\" said Abou. \"Nay, not so,\"\r\n  Replied the angel. Abou spoke more low,\r\n  But cheerily still; and said, \"I pray thee, then,\r\n  Write me as one that loves his fellow-men.\"\r\n\r\n    The angel wrote, and vanished. The next night\r\n  It came again with a great wakening light,\r\n  And showed the names whom love of God had blessed,\r\n  And, lo! Ben Adhem's name led all the rest.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Leigh Hunt._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIS WORLD\r\n\r\nThere is good in life and there is ill. The question is where we should\r\nput the emphasis.\r\n\r\n\r\n  This world that we're a-livin' in\r\n    Is mighty hard to beat;\r\n  You git a thorn with every rose,\r\n    But _ain't _the roses _sweet_!\r\n\r\n\r\n_Frank L. Stanton._\r\n\r\nFrom \"The Atlanta Constitution.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGRAY DAYS\r\n\r\n\r\nBy reckoning up the odds against us and ignoring the forces in our\r\nfavor, we may indeed close the door of hope. But why not take matters\r\nthe other way about? Why not see the situation clearly and then throw\r\nour own strong purpose in the scales? In the course of a battle an\r\nofficer reported to Stonewall Jackson that he must fall back because his\r\nammunition had been spoiled by a rainstorm. \"So has the enemy's,\" was\r\nthe instant reply. \"Give them the bayonet.\" This resolute spirit won the\r\nbattle.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Hang the gray days!\r\n  The deuce-to-pay days!\r\n  The feeling-blue and nothing-to-do days!\r\n  The sit-by-yourself-for-there's-nothing-new days!\r\n  When the cat that Care killed without excuse\r\n  With your inner self's crying, \"Oh, what's the use?\"\r\n  And you wonder whatever is going to become of you,\r\n  And you feel that a cipher expresses the sum of you;\r\n  And you know that you'll never,\r\n  Oh, never, be clever,\r\n  Spite of all your endeavor\r\n  Or hard work or whatever!\r\n  Oh, gee!\r\n  What a mix-up you see\r\n  When you look at the world where you happen to be!\r\n  Where strangers are hateful and friends are a bore,\r\n  And you know in your heart you will smile nevermore!\r\n  Gee, kid!\r\n  Clap on the lid!\r\n  It is all a mistake! Give your worries the skid!\r\n  There are sunny days coming\r\n    Succeeding the blue\r\n  And bees will be humming\r\n    Making honey for you,\r\n  And your heart will be singing\r\n    The merriest tune\r\n  While April is bringing\r\n    A May and a June!\r\n  Gray days?\r\n  Play days!\r\n  Joy-bringing pay days\r\n  And heart-lifting May days!\r\n  The sun will be shining in just a wee while\r\n  So smile!\r\n\r\n\r\n_Griffith Alexander._\r\n\r\nFrom \"The Philadelphia Evening Public Ledger.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EDMUND VANCE COOKE]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLAUGH A LITTLE BIT\r\n\r\n\r\n\"A merry heart doeth good like a medicine\"; a little laughter cures many\r\na seeming ill.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Here's a motto, just your fit--\r\n  Laugh a little bit.\r\n  When you think you're trouble hit,\r\n  Laugh a little bit.\r\n  Look misfortune in the face.\r\n  Brave the beldam's rude grimace;\r\n  Ten to one 'twill yield its place,\r\n  If you have the wit and grit\r\n  Just to laugh a little bit.\r\n\r\n  Keep your face with sunshine lit,\r\n  Laugh a little bit.\r\n  All the shadows off will flit,\r\n  If you have the grit and wit\r\n  Just to laugh a little bit.\r\n\r\n  Cherish this as sacred writ--\r\n  Laugh a little bit.\r\n  Keep it with you, sample it,\r\n  Laugh a little bit.\r\n  Little ills will sure betide you,\r\n  Fortune may not sit beside

It may involve quite the opposite.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Say not, \"I live!\"\r\n    Unless the morning's trumpet brings\r\n  A shock of glory to your soul,\r\n    Unless the ecstasy that sings\r\n  Through rushing worlds and insects' wings,\r\n    Sends you upspringing to your goal,\r\n  Glad of the need for toil and strife,\r\n    Eager to grapple hands with Life--\r\n  Say not, \"I live!\"\r\n\r\n  Say not, \"I live!\"\r\n    Unless the energy that rings\r\n  Throughout this universe of fire\r\n    A challenge to your spirit flings,\r\n  Here in the world of men and things,\r\n    Thrilling you with a huge desire\r\n  To mate your purpose with the stars,\r\n    To shout with Jupiter and Mars--\r\n  Say not, \"I live!\"\r\n\r\n  Say not, \"I live!\"\r\n    Such were a libel on the Plan\r\n  Blazing within the mind of God\r\n    Ere world or star or sun began.\r\n  Say rather, with your fellow man,\r\n    \"I grub; I burrow in the sod.\"\r\n  Life is not life that does not flame\r\n    With consciousness of whence it came--\r\n  Say not, \"I live!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Angela Morgan._\r\n\r\nFrom \"The Hour Has Struck.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA POOR UNFORTUNATE\r\n\r\n\r\nThings are never so bad but they might have been worse. An immigrant\r\ninto the South paid a negro to bring him a wild turkey. The next day he\r\ncomplained: \"You shouldn't shoot at the turkey's body, Rastus. Shoot at\r\nhis head. The flesh of that turkey was simply full of shot.\" \"Boss,\"\r\nsaid the negro, \"dem shot was meant for me.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n  I\r\n\r\n  His hoss went dead an' his mule went lame;\r\n  He lost six cows in a poker game;\r\n  A harricane came on a summer's day,\r\n  An' carried the house whar' he lived away;\r\n  Then a airthquake come when that wuz gone,\r\n  An' swallered the lan' that the house stood on!\r\n  An' the tax collector, _he_ come roun'\r\n  An' charged him up fer the hole in the groun'!\r\n  An' the city marshal--he come in view\r\n  An' said he wanted his street tax, too!\r\n\r\n  II\r\n\r\n  Did he moan an' sigh? Did he set an' cry\r\n  An' cuss the harricane sweepin' by?\r\n  Did he grieve that his ol' friends failed to call\r\n  When the airthquake come an' swallered all?\r\n  Never a word o' blame he said,\r\n  With all them troubles on top his head!\r\n  Not _him_.... He clumb to the top o' the hill--\r\n  Whar' standin' room wuz left him still,\r\n  An', barin' his head, here's what he said:\r\n  \"I reckon it's time to git up an' git;\r\n  But, Lord, I hain't had the measels yit!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Frank L. Stanton._\r\n\r\nFrom \"The Atlanta Constitution.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TRAINERS\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Franklin, seeking recognition and aid for his country at the French\r\ncourt, came news of an American disaster. \"Howe has taken Philadelphia,\"\r\nhis opponents taunted him. \"Oh, no,\" he answered, \"Philadelphia has\r\ntaken Howe.\" He shrewdly foresaw that the very magnitude of what the\r\nBritish had done would lull them into overconfidence and inaction, and\r\nwould stir the Americans to more determined effort. Above all, he\r\nhimself was undisturbed; for to the strong-hearted, trials and reverses\r\nare instruments of final success.\r\n\r\n\r\n  My name is Trouble--I'm a busy bloke--\r\n    I am the test of Courage--and of Class--\r\n  I bind the coward to a bitter yoke,\r\n    I drive the craven from the crowning pass;\r\n  Weaklings I crush before they come to fame;\r\n    But as the red star guides

weaker souls shall weep amid the throng\r\n    And fall before me, broken and dismayed;\r\n  But braver hearts shall know that I belong\r\n    And take me in, serene and unafraid.\r\n\r\n  My name's Defeat--but through the bitter fight,\r\n    To those who know, I'm something more than friend;\r\n  For I can build beyond the wrath of might\r\n    And drive away all yellow from the blend;\r\n  For those who quit, I am the final blow,\r\n    But for the brave who seek their chance to learn,\r\n  I show the way, at last, beyond the foe,\r\n    To where the scarlet flames of triumph burn.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Grantland Rice._\r\n\r\nFrom \"The Sportlight.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFE\r\n\r\n\r\nMost of us have failed or gone astray in one fashion or another, at one\r\ntime or another. But we need not become despondent at such times. We\r\nshould resolve to reap the full benefit of the discovery of our\r\nweakness, our folly.\r\n\r\n\r\n  All in the dark we grope along,\r\n    And if we go amiss\r\n  We learn at least which path is wrong,\r\n    And there is gain in this.\r\n\r\n  We do not always win the race\r\n    By only running right,\r\n  We have to tread the mountain's base\r\n    Before we reach its height.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  But he who loves himself the last\r\n    And knows the use of pain,\r\n  Though strewn with errors all his past,\r\n    He surely shall attain.\r\n\r\n  Some souls there are that needs must taste\r\n    Of wrong, ere choosing right;\r\n  We should not call those years a waste\r\n    Which led us to the light.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Etta Wheeler Wilcox._\r\n\r\nFrom \"Poems of Power.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA TOAST TO MERRIMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nA lady said to Whistler that there were but two painters--himself and\r\nVelazquez. He replied: \"Madam, why drag in Velazquez?\" So it is with\r\nJoyousness and Gloom. Both exist,--but why drag in Gloom?\r\n\r\n\r\n  Make merry! Though the day be gray\r\n  Forget the clouds and let's be gay!\r\n    How short the days we linger here:\r\n    A birth, a breath, and then--the bier!\r\n  Make merry, you and I, for when\r\n  We part we may not meet again!\r\n\r\n  What tonic is there in a frown?\r\n  You may go up and I go down,\r\n    Or I go up and you--who knows\r\n    The way that either of us goes?\r\n  Make merry! Here's a laugh, for when\r\n  We part we may not meet again!\r\n\r\n  Make merry! What of frets and fears?\r\n  There is no happiness in tears.\r\n    You tremble at the cloud and lo!\r\n    'Tis gone--and so 'tis with our woe,\r\n  Full half of it but fancied ills.\r\n  Make merry! 'Tis the gloom that kills.\r\n\r\n  Make merry! There is sunshine yet,\r\n  The gloom that promised, let's forget,\r\n    The quip and jest are on the wing,\r\n    Why sorrow when we ought to sing?\r\n  Refill the cup of joy, for then\r\n  We part and may not meet again.\r\n\r\n  A smile, a jest, a joke--alas!\r\n  We come, we wonder, and we pass.\r\n    The shadow falls; so long we rest\r\n    In graves,", "mimetype": "text/plain",

In this passage a disappointed and\r\nharassed king comments on the slumber which he cannot woo to his couch,\r\nyet which his humblest subject enjoys.\r\n\r\n\r\n  How many thousand of my poorest subjects\r\n  Are at this hour asleep! O sleep! O gentle sleep!\r\n  Nature's soft nurse, how have I frighted thee,\r\n  That thou no more wilt weigh my eyelids down\r\n  And steep my senses in forgetfulness?\r\n  Why rather, sleep, liest thou in smoky cribs,\r\n  Upon uneasy pallets stretching thee,\r\n  And hushed with buzzing night-flies to thy slumber,\r\n  Than in the perfumed chambers of the great,\r\n  Under the canopies of costly state,\r\n  And lulled with sound of sweetest melody?\r\n  O thou dull god! why liest thou with the vile\r\n  In loathsome beds, and leav'st the kingly couch\r\n  A watch-case or a common 'larum bell?\r\n  Wilt thou upon the high and giddy mast\r\n  Seal up the ship-boy's eyes, and rock his brains\r\n  In cradle of the rude imperious surge,\r\n  And in the visitation of the winds,\r\n  Who take the ruffian billows by the top,\r\n  Curling their monstrous heads, and hanging them\r\n  With deafning clamor in the slippery clouds,\r\n  That with the hurly death itself awakes?\r\n  Canst thou, O partial sleep! give thy repose\r\n  To the wet sea-boy in an hour so rude,\r\n  And in the calmest and most stillest night,\r\n  With all appliances and means to boot,\r\n  Deny it to a king? Then, happy low, lie down!\r\n  Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown.\r\n\r\n\r\n_William Shakespeare._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEVER TROUBLE TROUBLE\r\n\r\n\r\nTo borrow trouble is to contract a debt that any man is better without.\r\nIf your troubles are not borrowed, they are not likely to be many or\r\ngreat.\r\n\r\n\r\n    I used to hear a saying\r\n  That had a deal of pith;\r\n  It gave a cheerful spirit\r\n  To face existence with,\r\n  Especially when matters\r\n  Seemed doomed to go askew,\r\n  'Twas _Never trouble trouble\r\n  Till trouble troubles you._\r\n\r\n    Not woes at hand, those coming\r\n  Are hardest to resist;\r\n  We hear them stalk like giants,\r\n  We see them through a mist.\r\n  But big things in the brewing\r\n  Are small things in the brew;\r\n  So never trouble trouble\r\n  Till trouble troubles you.\r\n\r\n    Just look at things through", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 216233, "end_char_idx": 219942, "text_template":

clear, misgivings\r\n  Are just a bugaboo;\r\n  No more you'll trouble trouble\r\n  Till trouble troubles you.\r\n\r\n\r\n_St. Clair Adams._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCLEAR THE WAY\r\n\r\n\r\nHumanity is always meeting obstacles. All honor to the men who do not\r\nfear obstacles, but push them aside and press on. Stephenson was\r\nexplaining his idea that a locomotive steam engine could run along a\r\ntrack and draw cars after it. \"But suppose a cow gets on the track,\"\r\nsome one objected. \"So much the worse,\" said Stephenson, \"for the cow.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n  Men of thought! be up and stirring,\r\n    Night and day;\r\n  Sow the seed, withdraw the curtain,\r\n    Clear the way!\r\n  Men of action, aid and cheer them,\r\n    As ye may!\r\n  There's a fount about to stream,\r\n  There's a light about to gleam,\r\n  There's a warmth about to glow,\r\n  There's a flower about to blow;\r\n  There's midnight blackness changing\r\n    Into gray!\r\n  Men of thought and men of action,\r\n    Clear the way!\r\n\r\n  Once the welcome light has broken,\r\n    Who shall say\r\n  What the unimagined glories\r\n    Of the day?\r\n  What the evil that shall perish\r\n    In its ray?\r\n  Aid it, hopes of honest men;\r\n  Aid the dawning, tongue and pen;\r\n  Aid it, paper, aid it, type,\r\n  Aid it, for the hour is ripe;\r\n  And our earnest must not slacken\r\n    Into play.\r\n  Men of thought and men of action,\r\n    Clear the way!\r\n\r\n  Lo! a cloud's about to vanish\r\n      From the day;\r\n  And a brazen wrong to crumble\r\n      Into clay!\r\n  With the Right shall many more\r\n  Enter, smiling at the door;\r\n  With the giant Wrong shall fall\r\n  Many others great and small,\r\n  That for ages long have held us\r\n      For their prey.\r\n  Men of thought and men of action,\r\n      Clear the way!\r\n\r\n\r\n_Charles Mackay._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nONE FIGHT MORE\r\n\r\n\r\nWe need not expect much of the man who, when defeated, gives way either\r\nto despair or to a wild impulse for immediate revenge. But from the man\r\nwho stores up his strength quietly and bides his time for a new effort,\r\nwe may expect everything.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Now, think you, Life, I am defeated quite?\r\n    More than a single battle shall be mine\r\n  Before I yield the sword and give the sign\r\n    And turn, a crownless outcast, to the night.\r\n  Wounded, and yet unconquered in the fight,\r\n    I wait in silence till the day may shine\r\n  Once more upon my strength, and all the line\r\n    Of your defenses break before my might.\r\n\r\n  Mine be that warrior's blood who, stricken sore,\r\n    Lies in his quiet chamber till he hears\r\n  Afar the clash and clang of arms, and knows\r\n    The cause he lived for calls for him once more;\r\n  And straightway rises, whole and void of fears,\r\n    And armed, turns him singing to his foes.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Theodosia Garrison._\r\n\r\nFrom \"The Earth Cry.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA PSALM OF LIFE\r\n\r\nAt times this existence of ours seems to be meaningless; whether we have\r\nsucceeded or whether we have failed appears to make little difference to\r\nus, and therefore effort seems scarcely worth while. But Longfellow\r\ntells us this view is all wrong. The past can take care of itself, and\r\nwe need not even worry very much about the future; but if we are true to\r\nour own natures, we must be up and doing in the present. Time is short,\r\nand mastery in any field of human activity is so long a process that it\r\nforbids us to waste our moments. Yet we must learn also how to wait and\r\nendure. In short, we must not become slaves to either indifference or\r\nimpatience, but must make it our business to play a man's part in life.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Tell me not, in mournful numbers,\r\n    Life is but an empty dream!--\r\n  For the soul is dead that slumbers,\r\n    And things are not what they seem.\r\n\r\n  Life is real! Life is earnest!", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 219870, "end_char_idx": 223713, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}",

Life is earnest!\r\n    And the grave is not its goal;\r\n  Dust thou art, to dust returnest,\r\n    Was not spoken of the soul.\r\n\r\n  Not enjoyment, and not sorrow,\r\n    Is our destined end or way;\r\n  But to act, that each to-morrow\r\n    Find us farther than to-day.\r\n\r\n  Art is long, and Time is fleeting,\r\n    And our hearts, though stout and brave,\r\n  Still, like muffled drums, are beating\r\n    Funeral marches to the grave.\r\n\r\n  In the world's broad field of battle,\r\n    In the bivouac of Life,\r\n  Be not like dumb, driven cattle!\r\n    Be a hero in the strife!\r\n\r\n  Trust no Future, howe'er pleasant!\r\n    Let the dead Past bury its dead!\r\n  Act,--act in the living Present!\r\n    Heart within, and God o'erhead!\r\n\r\n  Lives of great men all remind us\r\n    We can make our lives sublime,\r\n  And, departing, leave behind us\r\n    Footprints on the sands of time;\r\n\r\n  Footprints, that perhaps another,\r\n    Sailing o'er life's solemn main,\r\n  A forlorn and shipwrecked brother,\r\n    Seeing, shall take heart again.\r\n\r\n  Let us, then, be up and doing,\r\n    With a heart for any fate;\r\n  Still achieving, still pursuing,\r\n    Learn to labor and to wait.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Henry Wadsworth Longfellow._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA CREED\r\n\r\nMen may seem sundered from each other; but the soul that each possesses,\r\nand the destiny common to all, invest them with a basic brotherhood.\r\n\r\n\r\n  There is a destiny that makes us brothers:\r\n    None goes his way alone:\r\n  All that we send into the lives of others\r\n    Comes back into our own.\r\n\r\n  I care not what his temples or his creeds,\r\n    One thing holds firm and fast--\r\n  That into his fateful heap of days and deeds\r\n    The soul of a man is cast.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Edwin Markham_\r\n\r\nFrom \"Lincoln, and Other Poems.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE CRY\r\n\r\nWe should win if we can. But in any case we should prove our manhood by\r\nfighting.\r\n\r\n\r\n  More than half beaten, but fearless,\r\n  Facing the storm and the night;\r\n  Breathless and reeling but tearless,\r\n  Here in the lull of the fight,\r\n  I who bow not but before thee,\r\n  God of the fighting Clan,\r\n  Lifting my fists, I implore Thee,\r\n  Give me the heart of a Man!\r\n\r\n  What though I live with the winners\r\n  Or perish with those who fall?\r\n  Only the cowards are sinners,\r\n  Fighting the fight is all.\r\n  Strong is my foe--he advances!\r\n  Snapt is my blade, O Lord!\r\n  See the proud banners and lances!\r\n  Oh, spare me this stub of a sword!\r\n\r\n  Give me no pity, nor spare me;\r\n  Calm not the wrath of my Foe.\r\n  See where he beckons to dare me!\r\n  Bleeding, half beaten--I go.\r\n  Not for the glory of winning,\r\n  Not for the fear of the night;\r\n  Shunning the battle is sinning--\r\n  Oh, spare me the heart to fight!\r\n\r\n  Red is the mist about me;\r\n  Deep is the wound in my side;\r\n  \"Coward\" thou criest to flout me?\r\n  O terrible Foe, thou hast lied!\r\n  Here with my battle before me,\r\n  God of the fighting Clan,\r\n  Grant that the woman who bore me\r\n  Suffered to suckle a Man!\r\n\r\n\r\n_John G.

The\r\nmeans of happiness are surprisingly simple. We need not be rich or\r\nhigh-placed or powerful in order to be content. In fact the lowly are\r\noften the best satisfied. Izaak Walton lived the simple life and thanked\r\nGod that there were so many things in the world of which he had no need.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Art thou poor, yet hast thou golden slumbers?\r\n    O sweet content!\r\n  Art thou rich, yet is thy mind perplexed?\r\n    O punishment!\r\n  Dost thou laugh to see how fools are vexed\r\n  To add to golden numbers, golden numbers?\r\n  O sweet content!

We should not\r\nthen weakly give over our purpose, but should set about attaining it by\r\nsome indirect method. A politician knows that one way of getting a man's\r\nvote is to please the man's wife, and that one way of pleasing the wife\r\nis to kiss her baby.\r\n\r\n\r\n  A baby mole got to feeling big,\r\n  And wanted to show how he could dig;\r\n  So he plowed along in the soft, warm dirt\r\n  Till he hit something hard, and it surely hurt!\r\n  A dozen stars flew out of his snout;\r\n  He sat on his haunches, began to pout;\r\n  Then rammed the thing again with his head--\r\n  His grandpap picked him up half dead.\r\n  \"Young man,\" he said, \"though your pate is bone.\r\n  You can't butt your way through solid stone.\r\n  This bit of advice is good, I've found:\r\n  If you can't go over or under, go round.\"\r\n\r\n  A traveler came to a stream one day,\r\n  And because it presumed to cross his way,\r\n  And wouldn't turn round to suit his whim\r\n  And change its course to go with him,\r\n  His anger rose far more than it should,\r\n  And he vowed he'd cross right where he stood.\r\n  A man said there was a bridge below,\r\n  But not a step would he budge or go.\r\n  The current was swift and the bank was steep,\r\n  But he jumped right in with a violent leap.\r\n  A fisherman dragged him out half-drowned:\r\n  \"When you can't go over or under, go round.\"\r\n\r\n  If you come to a place that you can't get _through,_\r\n  Or _over_ or _under_, the thing to do\r\n  Is to find a way _round_ the impassable wall,\r\n  Not say you'll go YOUR way or not at all.\r\n  You can always get to the place you're going,\r\n  If you'll set your sails as the wind is blowing.\r\n  If the mountains are high, go round the valley;\r\n  If the streets are blocked, go up some alley;\r\n  If the parlor-car's filled, don't scorn a freight;\r\n  If the front door's closed, go in the side gate.\r\n  To reach your goal this advice is sound:\r\n  If you can't go over or under, go round!\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Joseph Morris._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHICK IS THE DARKNESS\r\n\r\n\r\nHow many of us forget when the sun goes down that it will rise again!\r\n\r\n\r\n  Thick is the darkness--\r\n    Sunward, O, sunward!\r\n  Rough is the highway--\r\n    Onward, still onward!\r\n\r\n  Dawn harbors surely\r\n    East of the shadows.\r\n  Facing us somewhere\r\n    Spread the sweet meadows.\r\n\r\n  Upward and forward!\r\n    Time will restore us:\r\n  Light is above us,\r\n    Rest is before us.\r\n\r\n\r\n_William Ernest Henley._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BELLY AND THE MEMBERS\r\n\r\n(ADAPTED FROM \"CORIOLANUS\")\r\n\r\n\r\nNo doubt the world is cursed with grafters and parasites--men who live\r\noff the body economic and give nothing substantial in return. But an\r\nappearance of uselessness is not always proof of such. We should not\r\ncondemn men in ignorance. As old as Aesop is the fable of the rebellion\r\nof the other members of the body against the idle unproductiveness of\r\nthe belly. In this passage the fable is used as an answer to the\r\nplebeians of Rome who have complained that the patricians are merely an\r\nencumbrance.\r\n\r\n\r\n  There was a time when all the body's

is to submit. There are times\r\nwhen the right thing is to strive, to fight. To put forth one's best\r\neffort is itself a reward. But sometimes it brings a material reward\r\nalso. The frog that after falling into the churn found that it couldn't\r\njump out and wouldn't try, was drowned. The frog that kept leaping in\r\nbrave but seemingly hopeless endeavor at last churned the milk, mounted\r\nthe butter for a final effort, and escaped.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Submission? They have preached at that so long.\r\n  As though the head bowed down would right the wrong,\r\n    As though the folded hand, the coward heart\r\n  Were saintly signs of souls sublimely strong;\r\n    As though the man who acts the waiting part\r\n    And but submits, had little wings a-start.\r\n  But may I never reach that anguished plight\r\n  Where I at last grow weary of the fight.\r\n\r\n  Submission: \"Wrong of course must ever be\r\n  Because it ever was. 'Tis not for me\r\n    To seek a change; to strike the maiden blow.\r\n  'Tis best to bow the head and not to see;\r\n    'Tis best to dream, that we need never know\r\n    The truth. To turn our eyes away from woe.\"\r\n  Perhaps.

On whom would we wish to\r\ndepend in a time of need? Those who are not the slaves of fortune, but\r\nhave made the most of both her buffets and her rewards. Those who\r\ncontrol their fears and rash impulses, and do not give way to sudden\r\nemotion. Amid confusion and disaster men like these will stand, as\r\nJackson did at Bull Run, like a veritable stone wall.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice\r\n  And could of men distinguish, her election\r\n  Hath sealed thee for herself; for thou hast been\r\n  As one, in suffering all, that suffers nothing,\r\n  A man that fortune's buffets and rewards\r\n  Hast ta'en with equal thanks; and bless'd are those\r\n  Whose blood and judgment are so well commingled\r\n  That they are not a pipe for fortune's finger\r\n  To sound what stop she please.

They exist chiefly in our\r\nimaginations.\r\n\r\n\r\n  I stood before the bars of Fate\r\n  And bowed my head disconsolate;\r\n  So high they seemed, so fierce their frown.\r\n  I thought no hand could break them down.\r\n\r\n  Beyond them I could hear the songs\r\n  Of valiant men who marched in throngs;\r\n  And joyful women, fair and free,\r\n  Looked back and waved their hands to me.\r\n\r\n  I did not cry \"Too late! too late!\"\r\n  Or strive to rise, or rail at Fate,\r\n  Or pray to God. My coward heart,\r\n  Contented, played its foolish part.\r\n\r\n  So still I sat, the tireless bee\r\n  Sped o'er my head, with scorn for me,\r\n  And birds who build their nests in air\r\n  Beheld me, as I were not there.\r\n\r\n  From twig to twig, before my face,\r\n  The spiders wove their curious lace,\r\n  As they a curtain fine would see\r\n  Between the hindering bars and me.\r\n\r\n  Then, sudden change! I heard the call\r\n  Of wind and wave and waterfall;\r\n  From heaven above and earth below\r\n  A clear command--\"ARISE AND GO!\"\r\n\r\n  I upward sprang in all my strength,\r\n  And stretched my eager hands at length\r\n  To break the bars--no bars were there;\r\n  My fingers fell through empty air!\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ellen M.H.

It is also well to have\r\npurposes so lofty that we cannot carry them out; for these latter are\r\nthe mighty inner fires which warm our being at its core and without\r\nwhich our impulse to do even the lesser things would be feeble.\r\n\r\n\r\n  I had rather cut man's purpose deeper than\r\n  Achieving it be crowned as conqueror;\r\n  To will divinely is to accomplish more\r\n  Than a mere deed: it fills anew the wan\r\n  Aspect of life with blood; it draws upon\r\n  Sources beyond the common reach and lore\r\n  Of mortals, to replenish at its core\r\n  The God-impassioned energy of man.\r\n  And herewith all the worlds of deed and thought\r\n  Quicken again with meaning--pulse and thrill\r\n  With Deity--that had forgot His touch.\r\n  There is not any act avails so much\r\n  As this invisible wedding of the will\r\n  With Life--yea, though it seem to accomplish naught.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Henry Bryan Binns._\r\n\r\nFrom \"The Free Spirit.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHE WHOM A DREAM HATH POSSESSED\r\n\r\n\r\nThe man possessed by a vision is not perplexed, troubled, restricted, as\r\nthe rest of us are. He wanders yet is not lost from home, sees a million\r\ndawns yet never night descending, faces death and destruction and in\r\nthem finds triumph.\r\n\r\n\r\n  He whom a dream hath possessed knoweth no more of doubting,\r\n  For mist and the blowing of winds and the mouthing of words he scorns;\r\n  Not the sinuous speech of schools he hears, but a knightly shouting,\r\n  And never comes darkness down, yet he greeteth a million morns.\r\n\r\n  He whom a dream hath possessed knoweth no more of roaming;\r\n  All roads and the flowing of waves and the speediest flight he knows,\r\n  But wherever his feet are set, his soul is forever homing,\r\n  And going, he comes, and coming he heareth a call and goes.\r\n\r\n  He whom a dream hath possessed knoweth no more of sorrow,\r\n  At death and the dropping of leaves and the fading of suns he smiles,\r\n  For a dream remembers no past and scorns the desire of a morrow,\r\n  And a dream in a sea of doom sets surely the ultimate isles.\r\n\r\n  He whom a dream hath possessed treads the impalpable marches,\r\n  From the dust of the day's long road he leaps to a laughing star,\r\n  And the ruin of worlds that fall he views from eternal arches,\r\n  And rides God's battlefield in a flashing and golden car.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sheamus O Sheel._\r\n\r\nFrom \"The Lyric Year.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUCCESS\r\n\r\n\r\nAs necessity is the mother of

said that the battle of Waterloo was won on the\r\ncricket fields of Eton. English sport at its best is admirable; it asks\r\noutward triumph if possible, but far more it asks that one do his best\r\ntill the very end and treat his opponent with courtesy and fairness. The\r\nspirit thus instilled at school has again and again been carried in\r\nafter life into the large affairs of the nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n  There's a breathless hush in the Close to-night--\r\n    Ten to make and the match to win--\r\n  A bumping pitch and a blinding light,\r\n    An hour to play and the last man in.\r\n  And it's not for the sake of a ribboned coat\r\n    Or the selfish hope of a season's fame,\r\n  But his Captain's hand on his shoulder smote;\r\n    \"Play up! Play up! And play the game!\"\r\n\r\n  The sand of the desert is sodden red--\r\n    Red with the wreck of a square that broke;\r\n  The Gatling's jammed and the colonel dead,\r\n    And the regiment's blind with dust and smoke.\r\n  The river of death has brimmed his banks,\r\n    And England's far and Honor a name,\r\n  But the voice of a schoolboy rallies the ranks,\r\n    \"Play up! Play up! And play the game!\"\r\n\r\n  This is the word that year by year,\r\n    While in her place the School is set,\r\n  Every one of her sons must hear,\r\n    And none that hears it dare forget.\r\n  This they all with a joyful mind\r\n    Bear through life like a torch in flame,\r\n  And falling, fling to the host behind--\r\n    \"Play up! Play up! And play the game!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Henry Newbolt._\r\n\r\nFrom \"Admirals All, and Other Verses.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MAN WHO FRETS AT WORLDLY STRIFE\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Lord, what fools these mortals be!\" exclaims Puck in _A Mid-summer\r\nNight's Dream. _And well might the fairy marvel who sees folk vexing\r\nthemselves over matters that nine times out of ten come to nothing. Much\r\nwiser is the man who smiles at misfortunes, even when they are real ones\r\nand affect him personally. Charles Lamb once cheerfully helped to hiss\r\noff the stage a play he himself had written.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The man who frets at worldly strife\r\n    Grows sallow, sour, and thin;\r\n  Give us the lad whose happy life\r\n    Is one perpetual grin:\r\n  He, Midas-like, turns all to gold--\r\n    He smiles when others sigh,\r\n  Enjoys alike the hot and cold,\r\n    And laughs though wet or dry.\r\n\r\n  There's fun in everything we meet,--\r\n    The greatest, worst, and best;\r\n  Existence is a merry treat,\r\n    And every speech a jest:\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  So, come what may, the man's in luck\r\n    Who turns it all to glee,\r\n  And laughing, cries, with honest Puck,\r\n    \"Good Lord! what fools ye be.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Joseph Rodman Drake._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSERENITY\r\n\r\n\r\nCalmness of mind to face anything the future may have in store is\r\nexpressed in this quatrain.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Here's a sigh to those who love me\r\n    And a smile to those who hate;\r\n  And whatever sky's above me,\r\n    Here's a heart for every fate.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lord Byron._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHERE'S HOPIN'\r\n\r\n\r\nAn", "mimetype":

"Byron._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHERE'S HOPIN'\r\n\r\n\r\nAn optimist has been described as a man who orders oysters at a\r\nrestaurant and expects to find a pearl to pay the bill with. This of\r\ncourse is not optimism, but brazen brainlessness. Yet somehow the pearls\r\ncome only to those who expect them.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Year ain't been the very best;--\r\n  Purty hard by trouble pressed;\r\n  But the rough way leads to rest,--\r\n    Here's hopin'!\r\n\r\n  Maybe craps way short; the rills\r\n  Couldn't turn the silent mills;\r\n  But the light's behind the hills,--\r\n    Here's hopin'!\r\n\r\n  Where we planted roses sweet\r\n  Thorns come up an' pricked the feet;\r\n  But this old world's hard to beat,--\r\n    Here's hopin'!\r\n\r\n  P'r'aps the buildin' that we planned\r\n  'Gainst the cyclone couldn't stand;\r\n  But, thank God we've got the _land_,--\r\n    Here's hopin'!\r\n\r\n  Maybe flowers we hoped to save\r\n  Have been scattered on a grave;\r\n  But the heart's still beatin' brave,--\r\n    Here's hopin'!\r\n\r\n  That we'll see the mornin' light--\r\n  That the very darkest night\r\n  Can't hide heaven from our sight,--\r\n    Here's hopin'!\r\n\r\n\r\n_Frank L.

The man who\r\nis natural, who is open and kind of heart, is always first. The man who\r\nis merely rich or sheltered or proud is not even a good second.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Cleon hath a million acres, ne'er a one have I;\r\n  Cleon dwelleth in a palace, in a cottage I;\r\n  Cleon hath a dozen fortunes, not a penny I;\r\n  Yet the poorer of the twain is Cleon, and not I.\r\n\r\n  Cleon, true, possesses acres, but the landscape I;\r\n  Half the charm to me it yieldeth money can not buy,\r\n  Cleon harbors sloth and dullness, freshening vigor I;\r\n  He in velvet, I in fustian, richer man am I.\r\n\r\n  Cleon is a slave to grandeur, free as thought am I;\r\n  Cleon fees a score of doctors, need of none have I;\r\n  Wealth-surrounded, care-environed, Cleon fears to die;\r\n  Death may come, he'll find me ready, happier man am I.\r\n\r\n  Cleon sees no charm in nature, in a daisy I;\r\n  Cleon hears no anthems ringing in the sea and sky;\r\n  Nature sings to me forever, earnest listener I;\r\n  State for state, with all attendants, who would change?\r\n      Not I.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Charles Mackay_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PESSIMIST\r\n\r\n\r\nMost of our ills and troubles are not very serious when we come to\r\nexamine the realities of them. Or perhaps we expect too much. An old\r\nnegro was complaining that the railroad would not pay him for his mule,\r\nwhich it had killed--nay, would not even give him back his rope. \"What\r\nrope?\" he was asked. \"Why, sah,\"

withstand these woes.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ben King_.\r\n\r\nFrom \"Ben King's Verse.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are irritating, troublesome people about us. Of what use is it to\r\nbe irritating in our turn or to add to the trouble? Most offenders have\r\ntheir better side. Our wisest course is to find this and upon the basis\r\nof it build up a better relationship.\r\n\r\n\r\n    There's a fellow in your office\r\n  Who complains and carps and whines\r\n  Till you'd almost do a favor\r\n  To his heirs and his assigns.\r\n  But I'll tip you to a secret\r\n  (And this chap's of course involved)--\r\n  He's no foeman to be fought with;\r\n  He's a problem to be solved.\r\n\r\n    There's a duffer in your district\r\n  Whose sheer cussedness is such\r\n  He has neither pride nor manners--\r\n  No, nor gumption, overmuch.\r\n  'Twould be great to up and tell him\r\n  Where to go. But be resolved--\r\n  He's no foeman to be fought with,\r\n  Just a problem to be solved.\r\n\r\n    This old earth's (I'm sometimes thinking)\r\n  One menagerie of freaks--\r\n  Folks invested with abnormal\r\n  Lungs or brains or galls or beaks.\r\n  But we're not just shrieking monkeys\r\n  In a dim, vast cage revolved;\r\n  We're not foemen to be fought with,\r\n  Merely problems to be solved.\r\n\r\n\r\n_St. Clair Adams_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROSPICE\r\n\r\n\r\nHere the poet looks forward to death. He does not ask for an easy death;\r\nhe does not wish to creep past an experience which all men sooner or\r\nlater must face, and which many men have faced so heroically. He has\r\nfought well in life; he wishes to make the last fight too. The poem was\r\nwritten shortly after the death of Mrs. Browning, and the closing lines\r\nrefer to her.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Fear death?--to feel the fog in my throat,\r\n    The mist in my face,\r\n  When the snows begin, and the blasts denote\r\n    I am nearing the place,\r\n  The power of the night, the press of the storm,\r\n    The post of the foe;\r\n  Where he stands, the Arch Fear in a visible form,\r\n    Yet the strong man must go:\r\n  For the journey is done and the summit attained,\r\n    And the barriers fall,\r\n  Though a battle's to fight ere the guerdon be gained,\r\n    The reward of it all.\r\n  I was ever a fighter, so--one fight more,\r\n    The best and the last!\r\n  I would hate that death bandaged my eyes, and forbore.\r\n    And bade me creep past.\r\n  No! let me taste the whole of it, fare like my peers\r\n    The heroes of old,\r\n  Bear the brunt, in a minute pay glad life's arrears\r\n    Of pain, darkness and cold.\r\n  For sudden the worst turns the best to the brave,\r\n    The black minute's at end,\r\n  And the elements' rage, the fiend-voices that rave,\r\n    Shall dwindle, shall blend,\r\n  Shall change, shall become first a peace out of pain,\r\n    Then a light, then thy breast,\r\n  O thou soul of my soul! I shall clasp thee again,\r\n    And with God be the rest!\r\n\r\n\r\n_Robert Browning_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GREATNESS OF THE SOUL\r\n\r\n\r\nGeologists tell us that in the long processes of the ages mountains have\r\nbeen raised and leveled, continents formed and washed away. Astronomers\r\ntell us that in space are countless worlds, many of them doubtless\r\ninhabited--perhaps by creatures of a lower type than we, perhaps by\r\ncreatures of a higher. The magnitude of these changes and of these\r\nworlds makes the imagination reel. But on one thing we can rely--the\r\ngreatness of the human soul. On one thing we can confidently build--the\r\nmen whose spirit is lofty, divine.\r\n\r\n\r\n  For tho' the Giant Ages heave the hill\r\n  And break the shore, and evermore\r\n  Make and break, and work their will;\r\n  Tho' world on world in myriad myriads roll\r\n  Round us, each with different powers,\r\n  And other forms of life than ours,\r\n  What know we greater than the soul?",

Tennyson_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEINELET\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat sheer perseverance can accomplish, even in matters of the heart, is\r\nrevealed in this little poem written in Heine's mood of mingled\r\nseriousness and gayety.\r\n\r\n\r\n  He asked if she ever could love him.\r\n    She answered him, no, on the spot.\r\n  He asked if she ever could love him.\r\n    She assured him again she could not.\r\n\r\n  He asked if she ever could love him.\r\n    She laughed till his blushes he hid.\r\n  He asked if she ever could love him.\r\n    By God, she admitted she did.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Gamaliel Bradford_.\r\n\r\nFrom \"Shadow Verses.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTAND FORTH!\r\n\r\n\r\nThe human spirit can triumph over difficulties, as flowers bloom along\r\nthe edge of the Alpine snow.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Stand forth, my soul, and grip thy woe,\r\n  Buckle the sword and face thy foe.\r\n  What right hast thou to be afraid\r\n  When all the universe will aid?\r\n  Ten thousand rally to thy name,\r\n  Horses and chariots of flame.\r\n  Do others fear? Do others fail?\r\n  _My soul must grapple and prevail_.\r\n  My soul must scale the mountainside\r\n  And with the conquering army ride--\r\n  Stand forth, my soul!\r\n\r\n  Stand forth, my soul, and take command.\r\n  'Tis I, thy master, bid thee stand.\r\n  Claim thou thy ground and thrust thy foe,\r\n  Plead not thine enemy should go.\r\n  Let others cringe! My soul is free,\r\n  No hostile host can conquer me.\r\n  There lives no circumstance so great\r\n  Can make me yield, or doubt my fate.\r\n  My soul must know what kings have known.\r\n  Must reach and claim its rightful throne--\r\n  Stand forth, my soul!\r\n\r\n  I ask no truce, I have no qualms,\r\n  I seek no quarter and no alms.\r\n  Let those who will obey the sod,\r\n  My soul sprang from the living God.\r\n  'Tis I, the king, who bid thee stand;\r\n  Grasp with thy hand my royal hand--\r\n  Stand forth!\r\n\r\n\r\n_Angela Morgan_.\r\n\r\nFrom \"The Hour Has Struck.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WALT MASON]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIONS AND ANTS\r\n\r\n\r\n  Once a hunter met a lion near the hungry critter's lair, and the\r\n  way that lion mauled him was decidedly unfair; but the hunter\r\n  never whimpered when the surgeons, with their thread, sewed up\r\n  forty-seven gashes in his mutilated head; and he showed the\r\n  scars in triumph, and they gave him pleasant fame, and he\r\n  always blessed the lion that had camped upon his frame. Once\r\n  that hunter, absent minded, sat upon a hill of ants, and about\r\n  a million bit him, and you should have seen him dance! And he\r\n  used up lots of language of a deep magenta tint, and\r\n  apostrophized the insects in a style unfit to print. And it's\r\n  thus with worldly troubles; when the big ones come along, we\r\n  serenely go to meet them, feeling valiant, bold and strong, but\r\n  the weary little worries with their poisoned stings and smarts,\r\n  put the lid upon our courage, make us gray, and break our\r\n  hearts.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Walt Mason_.\r\n\r\nFrom \"Walt Mason, His Book.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFE, NOT DEATH\r\n\r\n\r\nSometimes life is so unsatisfying that we think we should like to be rid\r\nof it. But we really are not longing for death; we are longing for more\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Whatever crazy sorrow saith,\r\n  No life that breathes with human breath\r\n  Has ever truly longed for death.\r\n\r\n    'Tis life, whereof our nerves are scant,\r\n  Oh life, not death, for which we pant;\r\n  More life, and fuller, that I want.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Alfred Tennyson_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE UNMUSICAL SOLOIST\r\n\r\n\r\nIn any sort of athletic contest a man who individually is good--perhaps\r\neven of the very best--may be a poor member of the team because he\r\nwishes to do all the playing himself and will not co-operate with his\r\nfellows. Every coach knows how such a man hashes the game. The same\r\nthing is true in business or in anything else where many people work\r\ntogether; a really capable man often fails because he hogs the center of\r\nthe stage", "mimetype": "text/plain",

It is also a barrier to usefulness, for an egotistical man\r\nis necessarily selfish and a selfish man cannot co-operate.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Music hath charms--at least it should;\r\n  Even a homely voice sounds good\r\n  That sings a cheerful, gladsome song\r\n  That shortens the way, however long.\r\n  A screechy fife, a bass drum's beat\r\n  Is wonderful music to marching feet;\r\n  A scratchy fiddle or banjo's thump\r\n  May tickle the toes till they want to jump.\r\n  But one musician fills the air\r\n  With discords that jar folks everywhere.\r\n  A pity it is he ever was born--\r\n  The discordant fellow who toots his own horn.\r\n\r\n  He gets in the front where all can see--\r\n  \"Now turn the spot-light right on me,\"\r\n  He says, and sings in tones sonorous\r\n  His own sweet halleluiah chorus.\r\n  Refrain and verse are both the same--\r\n  The pronoun I or his own name.\r\n  He trumpets his worth with such windy tooting\r\n  That louder it sounds than cowboys shooting.\r\n  This man's a nuisance wherever he goes,\r\n  For the world soon tires of the chap who blows.\r\n  Whether mighty in station or hoer of corn,\r\n  Unwelcome's the fellow who toots his own horn.\r\n\r\n  The poorest woodchopper makes the most sound;\r\n  A poor cook clatters the most pans around;\r\n  The rattling spoke carries least of the load;\r\n  And jingling pennies pay little that's owed;\r\n  A rooster crows but lays no eggs;\r\n  A braggart blows but drives no pegs.\r\n  He works out of harmony with any team,\r\n  For others are skim milk and he is the cream.\r\n  \"The world,\" so far as he can see,\r\n  \"Consists of a few other folks and ME.\"\r\n  He richly deserves to be held in scorn--\r\n  The ridiculous fellow who toots his own horn.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Joseph Morris_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON DOWN THE ROAD\r\n\r\n\r\nHazlitt said that the defeat of the Whigs could be read in the shifting\r\nand irresolute countenance of Charles James Fox, and the triumph of the\r\nTories in Pitt's \"aspiring nose.\" The empires of the Montezumas are\r\nconquered by men who, like Cortez, risk everything in the enterprise and\r\nmake retreat impossible by burning their ships behind them.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Hold to the course, though the storms are about you;\r\n    Stick to the road where the banner still flies;\r\n  Fate and his legions are ready to rout you--\r\n    Give 'em both barrels--and aim for their eyes.\r\n\r\n  Life's not a rose bed, a dream or a bubble,\r\n    A living in clover beneath cloudless skies;\r\n  And Fate hates a fighter who's looking for trouble,\r\n    So give 'im both barrels--and shoot for the eyes.\r\n\r\n  Fame never comes to the loafers and sitters,\r\n    Life's full of knots in a shifting disguise;\r\n  Fate only picks on the cowards and quitters,\r\n    So give 'em both barrels--and aim for the eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Grantland Rice_.\r\n\r\nFrom \"The Sportlight.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEETIN' TROUBLE\r\n\r\n\r\nSome students of biology planned a trick on their professor. They took\r\nthe head of one beetle, the body of another of a totally different\r\nspecies, the wings of a third, the legs of a fourth. These members they\r\ncarefully pasted together. Then they asked the professor what kind of\r\nbug the creature was. He answered promptly, \"A humbug.\" Just such a\r\nmonstrosity is trouble--especially future trouble. Some things about it\r\nare real, but the whole combined menace is only an illusion, not a thing\r\nwhich actually exists at all. Face the trouble itself; give no heed to\r\nthat idea of it which invests it with a hundred dire calamities.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Trouble in the distance seems all-fired big--\r\n    Sorter makes you shiver

Does\r\nit end in self, or does it include our relations and our duties to our\r\nfellows? General William Booth of the Salvation Army was once asked to\r\nsend a Christmas greeting to his forces throughout the world. His life\r\nhad been spent in unselfish service; over the cable he sent but one\r\nword--OTHERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  This is my creed: To do some good,\r\n    To bear my ills without complaining,\r\n  To press on as a brave man should\r\n    For honors that are worth the gaining;\r\n  To seek no profits where I may,\r\n    By winning them, bring grief to others;\r\n  To do some service day by day\r\n    In helping on my toiling brothers\r\n\r\n  This is my creed: To close my eyes\r\n    To little faults of those around me;\r\n  To strive to be when each day dies\r\n    Some better than the morning found me;\r\n  To ask for no unearned applause,\r\n    To cross no river until I reach it;\r\n  To see the merit of the cause\r\n    Before I follow those who preach it.\r\n\r\n  This is my creed: To try to shun\r\n    The sloughs in which the foolish wallow;\r\n  To lead where I may be the one\r\n    Whom weaker men should choose to follow.\r\n  To keep my standards always high,\r\n    To find my task and always do it;\r\n  This is my creed--I wish that I\r\n    Could learn to shape my action to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_S.E.

In fact good things are usually done up in\r\nsmall parcels. \"I could eat you at a mouthful,\" roared a bulky opponent\r\nto the small and sickly Alexander H.

Though the third precept is the\r\nnoblest, the first and second are admirable also. The second is violated\r\non all hands.

beauty. But delightful as the immediate scene\r\nwas, it was by no means the best part of his experience. For long\r\nafterwards, when he least expected it, memory brought back the flowers\r\nto the eye of his spirit, filled his solitary moments with thoughts of\r\npast happiness, and took him once more (so to speak) into the free open\r\nair and the sunshine. Just so for us the memory of happy sights we have\r\nseen comes back again to bring us pleasure.\r\n\r\n\r\n  I wander'd lonely as a cloud\r\n  That floats on high o'er vales and hills,\r\n  When all at once I saw a crowd,\r\n  A host of golden daffodils,\r\n  Beside the lake, beneath the trees,\r\n  Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.\r\n\r\n  Continuous as the stars that shine\r\n  And twinkle on the milky way,\r\n  They stretch'd in never-ending line\r\n  Along the margin of a bay:\r\n  Ten thousand saw I at a glance\r\n  Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.\r\n\r\n  The waves beside them danced, but they\r\n  Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:--\r\n  A Poet could not but be gay\r\n  In such a jocund company!\r\n  I gazed--and gazed--but little thought\r\n  What wealth the show to me had brought;\r\n\r\n  For oft, when on my couch I lie\r\n  In vacant or in pensive mood,\r\n  They flash upon that inward eye\r\n  Which is the bliss of solitude;\r\n  And then my heart with pleasure fills,\r\n  And dances with the daffodils.\r\n\r\n\r\n_William Wordsworth._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FRANK L. STANTON]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA LITTLE THANKFUL SONG\r\n\r\n\r\nNo man is without a reason to be thankful. If he lacks gratitude, the\r\nfault lies at least partly with himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n  For what are we thankful for? For this:\r\n    For the breath and the sunlight of life\r\n  For the love of the child, and the kiss\r\n    On the lips of the mother and wife.\r\n      For roses entwining,\r\n        For bud and for bloom,\r\n      And hopes that are shining\r\n        Like stars in the gloom.\r\n\r\n  For what are we thankful for? For this:\r\n    The strength and the patience of toil;\r\n  For ever the dreams that are bliss--\r\n    The hope of the seed in the soil.\r\n      For souls that are whiter\r\n        From day unto day;\r\n      And lives that are brighter\r\n        From going God's way.\r\n\r\n  For what are we thankful for? For all:\r\n    The sunlight--the shadow--the song;\r\n  The blossoms may wither and fall,\r\n    But the world moves in music along!\r\n        For simple, sweet living,\r\n          (Tis love that doth teach it)\r\n        A heaven forgiving\r\n          And faith that can reach it!\r\n\r\n\r\n_Frank L. Stanton._\r\n\r\nFrom \"The Atlanta Constitution.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTWO RAINDROPS\r\n\r\n(A FABLE)\r\n\r\n\r\nAn egotist is not only selfish; he is usually ridiculous as well, for he\r\nsets us to wondering as to any possible ground for his exalted opinion\r\nof himself. The real workers do not emphasize their superiority to other\r\npeople, do not even emphasize the differences, but are grateful that\r\nthey may share in humanity's privilege of rendering service.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Two little raindrops were born in a shower,\r\n  And one was so pompously proud of his power,\r\n  He got in his head an extravagant notion\r\n  He'd hustle right off and swallow

brook\r\n  Called for a drink, but no notice he took\r\n  Of such trifling things. He must hurry to be\r\n  Not a mere raindrop, but the whole sea.\r\n  A stranded ship needed water to float,\r\n  But he could not bother to help a boat.\r\n  He leaped in the sea with a puff and a blare--\r\n  And nobody even knew he was there!\r\n\r\n  But the other drop as along it went\r\n  Found the work to do for which it was sent:\r\n  It refreshed the lily that drooped its head,\r\n  And bathed the grass that was almost dead.\r\n  It got under the ships and helped them along,\r\n  And all the while sang a cheerful song.\r\n  It worked every step of the way it went,\r\n  Bringing joy to others, to itself content.\r\n  At last it came to its journey's end,\r\n  And welcomed the sea as an old-time friend.\r\n  \"An ocean,\" it said, \"there could not be\r\n  Except for the millions of drops like me.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Joseph Morris,_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMY WAGE\r\n\r\n\r\nWe may as well aim high as low, ask much as little. The world will not\r\nmiss what it gives us, and our reward will largely be governed by our\r\ndemands.\r\n\r\n\r\n  I bargained with Life for a penny,\r\n  And Life would pay no more,\r\n  However I begged at evening\r\n  When I counted my scanty store;\r\n\r\n  For Life is a just employer,\r\n  He gives you what you ask,\r\n  But once you have set the wages,\r\n  Why, you must bear the task.\r\n\r\n  I worked for a menial's hire,\r\n  Only to learn, dismayed,\r\n  That any wage I had asked of Life,\r\n  Life would have paid.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Jessie B. Rittenhouse._\r\n\r\nFrom \"The Door of Dreams.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GIFT\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Trust thyself,\" says Emerson; \"every heart vibrates to that iron\r\nstring.\" This is wholesome and inspiring advice, but there is, as always,\r\nanother side to the question. Many a man falls into absurdities and\r\nmistakes because he cannot get outside of himself and look at himself\r\nfrom other people's eyes. We should cultivate the ability to see\r\neverything, including ourselves, from more than one standpoint.\r\n\r\n\r\n  O wad some Pow'r the giftie gie us\r\n    To see oursels as ithers see us!\r\n  It wad frae mony a blunder free us,\r\n    And foolish notion;\r\n  What airs in dress an' gait wad lea'e us,\r\n    And ev'n devotion!\r\n\r\n\r\n_Robert Burns._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROMETHEUS UNBOUND\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the poem from which this excerpt is taken, Prometheus the Titan has\r\nbeen cruelly tortured for opposing the malignant will of Jupiter. In the\r\nend Prometheus wins a complete outward victory. Better still, by his\r\nsteadfastness and high purpose he has won a great inward triumph. The\r\nspirit that has actuated him and the nature of his achievement are\r\nexpressed in the following lines.\r\n\r\n\r\n  To suffer woes which Hope thinks infinite;\r\n  To forgive wrongs darker than death or night;\r\n    To defy Power, which seems omnipotent;\r\n  To love, and bear; to hope till Hope creates\r\n  From its own wreck the thing it contemplates;\r\n    Neither to change, nor falter, nor repent;\r\n  This, like thy glory, Titan, is to be\r\n  Good, great and joyous, beautiful and free;\r\n  This is alone Life, Joy, Empire, and Victory.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Percy Bysshe Shelley._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVICTORY IN DEFEAT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great, radiant souls of earth--the Davids, the Shakespeares, the\r\nLincolns--know grief and affliction as well as joy and triumph. But\r\nadversity is never to them mere adversity; it\r\n\r\n  \"Doth suffer a sea-change\r\n  Into something rich and strange\";\r\n\r\nand in the crucible of character their suffering itself is transmuted\r\ninto song.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Defeat may serve as well as victory\r\n  To shake the soul and let the glory out.\r\n  When the great oak is straining in the wind,\r\n  The boughs drink in new beauty, and the trunk\r\n  Sends down a deeper root on the windward side.\r\n  Only the soul that knows the mighty grief\r\n  Can know the mighty rapture. Sorrows come\r\n  To stretch out spaces in the heart for joy.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Edwin Markham._\r\n\r\nFrom \"The Shoes of Happiness, and Other Poems.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RICHER", "mimetype":

Yet many a man has no\r\nreal riches; his stocks draw dividends in dollars and cents only.\r\n\r\n\r\n  When it comes to buying shares\r\n    In the mines of earth,\r\n  May I join the millionaires\r\n    Who are rich in mirth.\r\n\r\n  Let me have a heavy stake\r\n    In fresh mountain air--\r\n  I will promise now to take\r\n    All that you can spare.\r\n\r\n  When you're setting up your claim\r\n    In the Mines of Glee,\r\n  Don't forget to use my name--\r\n    You can count on me.\r\n\r\n  Nothing better can be won,\r\n    Freer from alloy,\r\n  Than a bouncing claim in \"Con-\r\n    Solidated Joy.\"\r\n\r\n  You can have your Copper Stocks\r\n    Gold and tin and coal--\r\n  What I'd have within my box\r\n    Has to do with Soul.\r\n\r\n_John Kendrick Bangs._\r\n\r\nFrom \"Songs of Cheer.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBRAVE LIFE\r\n\r\n\r\nTo be absolutely without physical fear may not be the highest courage;\r\nto shrink and quake, and yet stand at one's post, may be braver still.\r\nSo of success. It lies less in the attainment of some external end than\r\nin holding yourself to your purposes and ideals; for out of high loyalty\r\nand effort comes that intangible thing called character, which is no\r\nmere symbol of success, but success itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n  I do not know what I shall find on out beyond the final fight;\r\n  I do not know what I shall meet beyond the last barrage of night;\r\n  Nor do I care--but this I know--if I but serve within the fold\r\n  And play the game--I'll be prepared for all the endless years may hold.\r\n\r\n  Life is a training camp at best for what may wait beyond the years;\r\n  A training camp of toiling days and nights that lean to dreams and tears;\r\n  But each may come upon the goal, and build his soul above all Fate\r\n  By holding an unbroken faith and taking Courage for a mate.\r\n\r\n  Is not the fight itself enough that man must look to some behest?\r\n  Wherein does Failure miss Success if all engaged but do their best?\r\n  Where does the Victor's cry come in for wreath of fame or laureled brow\r\n  If one he vanquished fought as well as weaker muscle would allow?\r\n\r\n  If my opponent in the fray should prove to be a stronger foe--\r\n  Not of his making--but because the Destinies ordained it so;\r\n  If he should win--and I should lose--although I did my utmost part,\r\n  Is my reward the less than his if he should strive with equal heart?\r\n\r\n  Brave Life, I hold, is something more than driving upward to the peak;\r\n  Than smashing madly through the strong, and crashing onward through the\r\n            weak;\r\n  I hold the man who makes his fight against the raw game's crushing odds\r\n  Is braver than his brothers are who hold the favor of the gods.\r\n\r\n  On by the sky line, faint and vague, in that Far Country all must know,\r\n  No laurel crown of fame may wait beyond the sunset's glow;\r\n  But life has given me the chance to train and serve within the fold,\r\n  To meet the test--and be prepared for all the endless years may hold.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Grantland Rice._\r\n\r\nFrom \"The Sportlight.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA SONG OF TO-MORROW\r\n\r\n\r\nA night's sleep and a new day--these are excellent things to look\r\nforward to when one is weary or in trouble.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Li'l bit er trouble,\r\n    Honey, fer terday;\r\n  Yander come Termorrer--\r\n    Shine it all away!\r\n\r\n  Rainy Sky is sayin',\r\n    \"Dis'll never do!\r\n  Fetch dem rainbow ribbons,\r\n    En I'll dress in blue!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Frank L. Stanton._\r\n\r\nFrom \"The Atlanta Constitution.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GLAD SONG\r\n\r\n\r\nGladness begins with the first person, with you. But it may spread far,\r\nlike the ripples when you toss a stone in the water.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Sing a song, sing a song,\r\n  Ring the glad-bells all along;\r\n  Smile at him who frowns at you,\r\n  He will smile and then they're two.\r\n\r\n  Laugh a bit, laugh a bit,\r\n  Folks will soon be catching it,\r\n  Can't resist a happy face;\r\n  World will be a merry place.\r\n\r\n  Laugh a Bit and Sing

Morris._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPAINTING THE LILY\r\n\r\n\r\nMany people are not content to let well enough alone, but spoil what\r\nthey have by striving for an unnecessary and foolish improvement. If\r\nthey have a rich title, they try to ornament it still further; if they\r\nhave refined gold, they try to gild it; if they have a lily, they try to\r\npaint it into still purer color.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Therefore, to be possessed with double pomp,\r\n  To guard a title that was rich before,\r\n  To gild refined gold, to paint the lily,\r\n  To throw a perfume on the violet,\r\n  To smooth the ice, or add another hue\r\n  Unto the rainbow, or with taper-light\r\n  To seek the beauteous eye of heaven to garnish,\r\n  Is wasteful and ridiculous excess.\r\n\r\n\r\n_William Shakespeare._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA PRETTY GOOD WORLD\r\n\r\n\r\nThe world has its faults, but few of us would give it up till we have\r\nto.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Pretty good world if you take it all round--\r\n    Pretty good world, good people!\r\n  Better be on than under the ground--\r\n    Pretty good world, good people!\r\n  Better be here where the skies are as blue\r\n    As the eyes of your sweetheart a-smilin' at you--\r\n  Better than lyin' 'neath daisies and dew--\r\n    Pretty good world, good people!\r\n\r\n  Pretty good world with its hopes and its fears--\r\n    Pretty good world, good people!\r\n  Sun twinkles bright through the rain of its tears--\r\n    Pretty good world, good people!\r\n  Better be here, in the pathway you know--\r\n    Where the thorn's in the garden where sweet roses grow,\r\n  Than to rest where you feel not the fall o' the snow--\r\n    Pretty good world, good people!\r\n\r\n  Pretty good world! Let us sing it that way--\r\n    Pretty good world, good people!\r\n  Make up your mind that you're in it to stay--\r\n    At least for a season, good people!\r\n  Pretty good world, with its dark and its bright--\r\n    Pretty good world, with its love and its light;\r\n  Sing it that way till you whisper, \"Good-night!\"--\r\n    Pretty good world, good people!\r\n\r\n\r\n_Frank L. Stanton._\r\n\r\nFrom \"The Atlanta Constitution.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nODE TO DUTY\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the first stanza the poet hails duty as coming from God. It is a\r\nlight to guide us and a rod to check. To obey it does not lead to\r\nvictory; to obey it _is_ victory--is to live by a high, noble law. In\r\nthe second stanza he admits that some people do right without driving\r\nthemselves to it--do it by instinct and \"the genial sense of youth.\" In\r\nstanza 3 he looks forward to a time when all people will be thus\r\nblessed, but he thinks that as yet it is unsafe for most of us to lose\r\ntouch completely with stern, commanding duty. In stanzas 4 and 5 he\r\nstates that he himself has been too impatient of control, has wearied\r\nhimself by changing from one desire to another, and now wishes to\r\nregulate his life by some great abiding principle. In stanza 6 he\r\ndeclares that duty, though stern, is benignant; the flowers bloom in\r\nobedience to it, and the stars keep their places. In the final stanza he\r\ndedicates his life to its service.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Stern Daughter of the Voice of God!\r\n    O Duty! if that name thou love\r\n    Who art a light to guide, a rod\r\n    To check the erring, and reprove;\r\n    Thou who art victory and law\r\n    When empty terrors overawe;\r\n    From vain temptations dost set free,\r\n  And calm'st the weary strife of frail humanity!\r\n\r\n    There are who ask not if thine eye\r\n    Be on them; who, in love and truth\r\n    Where no misgiving is, rely\r\n    Upon the genial sense of youth:\r\n    Glad hearts! without reproach or blot,\r\n    Who do thy work, and know it not:\r\n    Oh! if through confidence misplaced\r\n  They fail, thy saving arms, dread Power! around them cast.\r\n\r\n    Serene will be our days

Yet that\r\nwhich is so easy to give we too often reserve for a few, and those\r\nperhaps the least appreciative.\r\n\r\n\r\n  I knew a girl who had a beau\r\n  And his name wasn't Adams--\r\n  No child of hers would ever call\r\n  The present writer \"daddums.\"\r\n  I didn't love the girl, but still\r\n  I found her most beguiling;\r\n  And so did all the other chaps--\r\n  She did it with her smiling.\r\n  \"I'm not a one-man girl,\" she said--\r\n  \"Of smiles my beau first took his;\r\n  But some are left; I'll syndicate\r\n  And pass them round like cookies.\"\r\n\r\n        That syndicated smile!\r\n      When trouble seemed the most in style,\r\n      It heartened us--\r\n              That indicated,\r\n                      Syndicated\r\n                              Smile.\r\n\r\n  It's not enough to please your boss\r\n  Or fawn round folks with bankrolls;\r\n  Be just as friendly to the guys\r\n  Whose homespun round their shank rolls.\r\n  The best investment in the world\r\n  Is goodwill, twenty carat;\r\n  It costs you nothing, brings returns;\r\n  So get yours out and air it.\r\n  A niggard of good nature cheats\r\n  Himself and wrongs his fellows.\r\n  You'd serve mankind?

"Smile.\r\n\r\n\r\n_St. Clair Adams._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFAIRY SONG\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great beneficent forces of life are not exhausted when once used,\r\nbut are recurrent. The sun rises afresh each new day. Once a year the\r\nspringtime returns and \"God renews His ancient rapture.\" So it is with\r\nour joys. They do not stay by us constantly; they pass from us and are\r\ngone; but we need not trouble ourselves--they are sure to come back.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Shed no tear! O shed no tear!\r\n  The flower will bloom another year.\r\n  Weep no more! O weep no more!\r\n  Young buds sleep in the root's white core.\r\n  Dry your eyes! O dry your eyes,\r\n  For I was taught in Paradise\r\n  To ease my breast of melodies--\r\n      Shed no tear.\r\n\r\n  Overhead! look overhead,\r\n  'Mong the blossoms white and red--\r\n  Look up, look up--I flutter now\r\n  On this flush pomegranate bough.\r\n  See me! 'tis this silvery bill\r\n  Ever cures the good man's ill.\r\n  Shed no tear! O shed no tear!\r\n  The flowers will bloom another year.\r\n  Adieu, adieu--I fly, adieu,\r\n  I vanish in the heaven's blue--\r\n      Adieu, adieu!\r\n\r\n\r\n_John Keats._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRAISE THE GENEROUS GODS FOR GIVING\r\n\r\n\r\nSome of us find joy in toil, some in art, some in the open air and the\r\nsunshine. All of us find it in simply being alive. Life is the gift no\r\ncreature in his right mind would part with. As Milton asks,\r\n\r\n  \"For who would lose,\r\n  Though full of pain, this intellectual being,\r\n  These thoughts that wander through eternity,\r\n  To perish rather, swallowed up and lost\r\n  In the wide womb of uncreated night,\r\n  Devoid of sense and motion?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n  Praise the generous gods for giving\r\n    In a world of wrath and strife,\r\n  With a little time for living,\r\n    Unto all the joy of life.\r\n\r\n  At whatever source we drink it,\r\n    Art or love or faith or wine,\r\n  In whatever terms we think it,\r\n    It is common and divine.\r\n\r\n  Praise the high gods, for in giving\r\n    This to man, and this alone,\r\n  They have made his chance of living\r\n    Shine the equal of their own.\r\n\r\n\r\n_William Ernest Henley._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOWARDS\r\n\r\n\r\nWe might as well accept the inevitable as the inevitable. There is no\r\nescaping death or taxes.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Cowards die many times before their deaths:\r\n  The valiant never taste of death but once.\r\n  Of all the wonders that I yet have heard,\r\n  It seems to me most strange that men should fear;\r\n  Seeing that death, a necessary end,\r\n  Will come, when it will come.\r\n\r\n\r\n_William Shakespeare._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WORD\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Cumaean sibyl offered Tarquin the Proud nine books for what seemed\r\nan exorbitant sum. He refused. She burned three of the books, and placed\r\nthe same price on the six as on the original nine. Again he refused. She\r\nburned three more books, and offered the remainder for the sum she first\r\nnamed. This time Tarquin accepted. The books were found to contain\r\nprophecies and invaluable directions regarding Roman policy, but alas,\r\nthey were no longer complete. So it is with joy. To take it now is to\r\nget it in its entirety. To defer until some other occasion is to get\r\nless of it--at the same cost.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Today, whatever may annoy,\r\n  The word for it is Joy, just simple joy:\r\n  The joy of life;\r\n  The joy of children and of wife;\r\n  The joy of bright blue skies;\r\n  The joy of rain; the glad surprise\r\n  Of twinkling stars that shine at night;\r\n  The joy of winged things upon their flight;\r\n  The joy of noonday, and the tried,\r\n  True joyousness of eventide;\r\n  The joy of labor and of mirth;\r\n  The joy of air, and sea, and earth--\r\n  The countless joys that ever flow from Him\r\n  Whose vast beneficence doth dim\r\n  The lustrous light of day,\r\n  And lavish gifts divine upon our way.\r\n  Whatever there be of Sorrow\r\n  I'll put off till To-morrow,\r\n  And when To-morrow comes, why, then\r\n  'Twill be To-day, and Joy again!\r\n\r\n\r\n_John Kendrick", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 287076, "end_char_idx": 290892, "text_template":

Atlantic Monthly.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nENVOI\r\n\r\n\r\nFranklin K. Lane stipulated that when he died his body should be\r\ncremated and the ashes scattered from El Capitan over the beautiful\r\nYosemite Valley. He thus symbolized what many of us feel--the unity of\r\nour deeper and finer selves with the eternal life and loveliness of\r\nnature.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Oh seek me not within a tomb;\r\n  Thou shalt not find me in the clay!\r\n  I pierce a little wall of gloom\r\n  To mingle with the Day!\r\n\r\n  I brothered with the things that pass,\r\n  Poor giddy Joy and puckered Grief;\r\n  I go to brother with the Grass\r\n  And with the sunning Leaf.\r\n\r\n  Not Death can sheathe me in a shroud;\r\n  A joy-sword whetted keen with pain,\r\n  I join the armies of the Cloud\r\n  The Lightning and the Rain.\r\n\r\n  Oh subtle in the sap athrill,\r\n  Athletic in the glad uplift,\r\n  A portion of the Cosmic Will,\r\n  I pierce the planet-drift.\r\n\r\n  My God and I shall interknit\r\n  As rain and Ocean, breath and Air;\r\n  And oh, the luring thought of it\r\n  Is prayer!\r\n\r\n\r\n_John G. Neihardt_\r\n\r\nFrom \"The Quest\" (collected lyrics).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJAW\r\n\r\n\r\nWe all like a firm, straightforward chin provided it is not ruled by a\r\nwagging, gossiping tongue.\r\n\r\n\r\n  This fellow's jaw is built so frail\r\n  That you could break it like a weed;\r\n  That fellow's chin retreats until\r\n  You'd think it in a wild stampede.\r\n  Defects like these but show how soon\r\n  The purpose droops, the spirits flag--\r\n  We like a jaw that's made of steel,\r\n  Just so it's not inclined to wag.\r\n\r\n  The lower jaw should be as strong\r\n  And changeless as a granite cliff;\r\n  Its very look should be a _thus_\r\n  And not a _maybe, somehow, if;_\r\n  Should mark a soul so resolute\r\n  It will not fear or cease or lag--\r\n  We need a rugged mandible,\r\n  Provided we don't let it wag.\r\n\r\n  Yes, with endurance, let it too\r\n  A tender modesty possess;\r\n  And to its grim strength let it add\r\n  The gracious power of gentleness.\r\n  Above all, let its might of deeds\r\n  Induce no loud or vulgar brag--\r\n  We like to see a good, firm jaw,\r\n  But do not wish to hear it wag.\r\n\r\n\r\n_St. Clair Adams._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CONQUEROR\r\n\r\n\r\nAge is wise; it attempts nothing impossible. Youth is wiser; it believes\r\nnothing impossible. Age conserves more; youth accomplishes more. Between\r\nthe two is an irreconcilable difference.\r\n\r\n  \"Crabb\u00e9d age and youth\r\n  Cannot live together,\"\r\n\r\nas Shakespeare says. And the sympathy of the world is with youth. It is\r\nbetter so; for though many cherished things would be saved from\r\nsacrifice if rash immaturity were more often checked, progress would be\r\nstayed if life were dominated by sterile and repressive age.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Room for me, graybeards, room, make room!\r\n  Menace me not with your eyes of gloom;\r\n  Jostle me not from the place I seek,\r\n  For my arms are strong and your own are weak,\r\n  And if my plea to you be denied\r\n  I'll thrust your wearying forms aside.\r\n  Pity you? Yes, but I cannot stay;\r\n  I am the spirit of Youth; make way!\r\n\r\n  Room for me, timid ones, room, make room!\r\n  Little I care for your fret and fume--\r\n  I laugh at sorrow and jeer defeat;\r\n  To doubt and doubters I give the lie,\r\n  And fear is stilled as I swagger by,\r\n  And life's a fight and I seek the fray;\r\n  I am the spirit of Youth; make way!\r\n\r\n  Room for me, mighty ones, room, make room!\r\n  I fear no power and dread no doom;\r\n  And you who curse me and you who bless\r\n  Alike must bow to my dauntlessness.\r\n  I topple the king from his golden throne,\r\n  I smash old idols of brass and stone,\r\n  I am not hampered by yesterday.\r\n  Room for the spirit of Youth; make way!\r\n\r\n  Room for me, all of you, make me room!\r\n  Where the rifles clash and the cannon boom,\r\n  Where glory beckons or love or fame\r\n  I plunge me heedlessly in the game.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 290840, "end_char_idx": 294677,

RAINING, LITTLE FLOWER?\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Sweet are the uses of adversity.\" They bring us benefits not otherwise\r\nto be had. To mope because of them is foolish. Showers alternate with\r\nsunshine, sorrows with pleasure, pain and weariness with comfort and\r\nrest; but accept the one as necessary to the other, and you will enjoy\r\nboth.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Is it raining, little flower?\r\n    Be glad of rain.\r\n  Too much sun would wither thee,\r\n    'Twill shine again.\r\n  The sky is very black, 'tis true,\r\n    But just behind it shines\r\n      The blue.\r\n\r\n  Art thou weary, tender heart?\r\n    Be glad of pain;\r\n  In sorrow the sweetest things will grow\r\n    As flowers in the rain.\r\n  God watches and thou wilt have sun\r\n    When clouds their perfect work\r\n      Have done.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Anonymous_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGRADATIM\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the old fable the tortoise won the race from the hare, not by a\r\nsingle burst of speed, but by plodding on steadily, tirelessly. In the\r\nCivil War it was found that Lee's army could not be overwhelmed in a\r\nsingle battle, but one Federal general perceived that it could be worn\r\ndown by time and the pressure of numbers. \"I propose,\" said Grant, \"to\r\nfight it out on this line if it takes all summer.\" It took more than a\r\nsummer; it took nearly a year--but he did it. In the moral realm\r\nlikewise, \"All things excellent are as difficult as they are rare.\"\r\nCharacter is not attained over-night. The only way to develop moral\r\nmuscles is to exercise them patiently and long.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Heaven is not reached at a single bound;\r\n    But we build the ladder by which we rise\r\n    From the lowly earth to the vaulted skies,\r\n  And we mount to its summit, round by round.\r\n\r\n  I count this thing to be grandly true:\r\n    That a noble deed is a step towards God,--\r\n    Lifting the soul from the common clod\r\n  To a purer air and a broader view.\r\n\r\n  We rise by the things that are under feet;\r\n    By what we have mastered of good and gain;\r\n    By the pride deposed and the passion slain,\r\n  And the vanquished ills that we hourly meet.\r\n\r\n  We hope, we aspire, we resolve, we trust,\r\n    When the morning calls us to life and light,\r\n    But our hearts grow weary, and, ere the night,\r\n  Our lives are trailing the sordid dust.\r\n\r\n  We hope, we resolve, we aspire, we pray,\r\n    And we think that we mount the air on wings\r\n    Beyond the recall of sensual things,\r\n  While our feet still cling to the heavy clay.\r\n\r\n  Wings for the angels, but feet for men!\r\n    We may borrow the wings to find the way--\r\n    We may hope, and resolve, and aspire, and pray;\r\n  But our feet must rise, or we fall again.\r\n\r\n  Only in dreams is a ladder thrown\r\n    From the weary earth to the sapphire walls;\r\n    But the dreams depart, and the vision falls,\r\n  And the sleeper wakes on his pillow of stone.\r\n\r\n  Heaven is not reached at a single bound;\r\n    But we build the ladder by which we rise\r\n    From the lowly earth to the vaulted skies,\r\n  And we mount to its summit, round by round.\r\n\r\n\r\n_J.G.

Yes, a multiplicity of forces and interests, and each of them,\r\neven the disagreeable, may be of real help to us. It's good for a dog,\r\nsays a shrewd philosopher, to be pestered with fleas; it keeps him from\r\nthinking too much about being a dog.\r\n\r\n\r\n  What's life? A story or a song;\r\n    A race on any track;\r\n  A gay adventure, short or long,\r\n    A puzzling nut to crack;\r\n  A grinding task; a pleasant stroll;\r\n    A climb; a slide down hill;\r\n  A constant striving for a goal;\r\n    A cake; a bitter pill;\r\n  A pit where fortune flouts or stings;\r\n    A playground full of fun;--\r\n  With many any of these things;\r\n    With others all in one.\r\n  What's life? To love the things we see;\r\n    The hills that touch the skies;\r\n  The smiling sea; the laughing lea;\r\n    The light in woman's eyes;\r\n  To work and love the work we do;\r\n    To play a game that's square;\r\n  To grin a bit when feeling blue;\r\n    With friends our joys to share;\r\n  To smile, though games be lost or won;\r\n    To earn our daily bread;--\r\n  And when at last the day is done\r\n    To tumble into bed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Griffith Alexander,_\r\n\r\nFrom \"The Philadelphia Evening Public Ledger.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOE YOUR ROW\r\n\r\n\r\nWe must not dream of harvests and neglect the toil that produces them.\r\n\r\n\r\n  De fiel's 'll soon be hummin'\r\n    Roun' de country high en low;\r\n  De harves' is a-comin':\r\n    Hoe yo' row!\r\n    Hoe yo' row!\r\n\r\n  No time now fer de sleeper;\r\n    It's \"Git up now, en go!\"\r\n  It's de sower makes de reaper;\r\n    Hoe yo' row!\r\n    Hoe yo' row!\r\n\r\n  It's sweet de birds is singin'\r\n    De songs you lovin' so;\r\n  But de harves' bells is ringin';\r\n    Hoe yo' row!\r\n    Hoe yo' row!\r\n\r\n\r\n_Frank L.

The swindler swindles himself,\" says\r\nEmerson. Apparent gain may be actual loss; material escape may be\r\nspiritual imprisonment. Any one may idle; but the men who are not\r\ncontent unless they climb the unscalable mountains or cross the\r\nuncharted seas or bear the burdens that others shrink from, are the ones\r\nwho keep the heritage of the spirit undiminished.\r\n\r\n\r\n  I do not pray for peace nor ease,\r\n  Nor truce from sorrow:\r\n  No suppliant on servile knees\r\n  Begs here against to-morrow!\r\n\r\n  Lean flame against lean flame we flash,\r\n  O, Fates that meet me fair;\r\n  Blue steel against blue steel we clash--\r\n  Lay on, and I shall dare!\r\n\r\n  But Thou of deeps the awful Deep,\r\n  Thou Breather in the clay,\r\n  Grant this my only prayer--Oh keep\r\n  My soul from turning gray!\r\n\r\n  For until now, whatever wrought\r\n  Against my sweet desires,\r\n  My days were smitten harps strung taut,\r\n  My nights were slumbrous lyres.\r\n\r\n  And howsoe'er the hard blow rang\r\n  Upon my battered shield,\r\n  Some lark-like, soaring spirit sang\r\n  Above my battlefield.\r\n\r\n  And through my soul of stormy night\r\n  The zigzag blue flame ran.\r\n  I asked no odds--I fought my fight--\r\n  Events against a man.\r\n\r\n  But now--at last--the gray mist chokes\r\n  And numbs me. _Leave me pain!\r\n  Oh let me feel the biting strokes\r\n  That I may fight again!_\r\n\r\n\r\n_John G. Neihardt._\r\n\r\nFrom \"The Quest\" (collected lyrics).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTEADFAST\r\n\r\n\r\nNo one ever has a trouble so great that some other person has not a\r\ngreater. The thought of the heroism shown by those more grievously\r\nafflicted than we, helps us to bear our own ills patiently.\r\n\r\n\r\n  If I can help another bear an ill\r\n    By bearing mine with somewhat of good grace--\r\n    Can take Fate's thrusts with not too long a face\r\n  And help him through his trials, then I WILL!\r\n    For do not braver men than I decline\r\n    To bow to troubles graver, far, than mine?\r\n\r\n  Pain twists this body? Yes, but it shall not\r\n    Distort my soul, by all the gods that be!\r\n    And when it's done its worst, Pain's victory\r\n  Shall be an empty one! Whate'er my lot,\r\n    My banner, ragged, but nailed to the mast,\r\n    Shall fly triumphant to the very last!\r\n\r\n  Others so much worse off than I have fought;\r\n    Have smiled--have met defeat with unbent head\r\n    They shame me into following where they led.\r\n  Can I ignore the lesson they have taught?\r\n    Strike hands with me! Dark is the way we go,\r\n    But souls-courageous line it--that I know!\r\n\r\n\r\n_Everard Jack Appleton._\r\n\r\nFrom \"The Quiet Courage.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIF\r\n\r\n\r\n  If I were fire I'd burn the world away.\r\n  If I were wind I'd turn my storms thereon,\r\n  If I were water I'd soon let it drown.\r\n\r\n_Cecco Angolieri._\r\n\r\n\r\n  If I were fire I'd seek the frozen North\r\n  And warm it till it blossomed fairly forth\r\n  And in the sweetness of its smiling mien\r\n  Resembled some soft southern garden scene.\r\n  And when the winter came again I'd seek\r\n  The chilling homes of lowly ones and meek\r\n  And do my small but most efficient part\r\n  To bring a wealth of comfort to the heart.\r\n\r\n  If I were wind I'd turn my breath upon\r\n  The calm-bound mariner until, anon,\r\n  The eager craft on which he sailed should find\r\n  The harbor blest towards which it hath inclined.\r\n  And in the city streets, when summer's days\r\n  Were withering the souls with scorching rays,\r\n  I'd seek the fevered brow and aching eyes\r\n  And take to them a touch of Paradise.\r\n\r\n  If I were water it would be my whim\r\n  To seek out all earth's desert places grim,\r\n  And turn each arid acre to a fair\r\n  Lush home of flowers and oasis rare.\r\n  Resolved in dew, I'd nestle in", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 305574, "end_char_idx": 309421,

win my way into the verse\r\n  Of some grand singer of Man's Brotherhood,\r\n  And prove myself so pure, so fraught with good.\r\n  That all the world would bless me for the cup\r\n  Of happiness I'd

Why are we never at absolute peace\r\nor rest? Many are the answers that have been made to this question. The\r\nanswer here given by the poet is that so richly is man endowed with\r\nqualities and attributes that if contentment were added to them, he\r\nwould be satisfied with what he has, and would not strive for that which\r\nis higher still--the fulfilment of his spiritual cravings.\r\n\r\n\r\n    When God at first made Man,\r\n  Having a glass of blessings standing by;\r\n  Let us (said He) pour on him all we can:\r\n  Let the world's riches, which dispers\u00e9d lie,\r\n    Contract into a span.\r\n\r\n    So strength first made a way;\r\n  Then beauty flow'd, then wisdom, honor, pleasure\r\n  When almost all was out, God made a stay,\r\n  Perceiving that alone, of all His treasure,\r\n    Rest in the bottom lay.\r\n\r\n    For if I should (said He)\r\n  Bestow this jewel also on My creature,\r\n  He would adore My gifts instead of Me,\r\n  And rest in Nature, not the God of Nature.\r\n    So both should losers be.\r\n\r\n    Yet let him keep the rest,\r\n  But keep them with repining restlessness:\r\n  Let him be rich and weary, that at least,\r\n  If goodness lead him not, yet weariness\r\n    May toss him to My breast.\r\n\r\n\r\n_George Herbert._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA PHILOSOPHER\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The web of our life is of mingled yarn, good and ill together,\" says\r\nShakespeare. It behooves us therefore to find the good and to make the\r\nbest of the ill. Two men were falling from an aeroplane. \"I'll bet you\r\nfive dollars,\" said one, \"that I hit the ground first.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    To take things as they be--\r\n    Thet's my philosophy.\r\n  No use to holler, mope, or cuss--\r\n  If they was changed they might be wuss.\r\n\r\n    If rain is pourin' down,\r\n    An' lightnin' buzzin' roun',\r\n  I ain't a-fearin' we'll be hit,\r\n  But grin thet I ain't out in it.\r\n\r\n    If I got deep in debt--\r\n    It hasn't happened yet--\r\n  And owed a man two dollars, Gee!\r\n  Why I'd be glad it wasn't three.\r\n\r\n    If some one come along,\r\n    And tried to do me wrong,\r\n  Why I should sort of take a whim\r\n  To thank the Lord I wasn't him.\r\n\r\n    I never seen a night\r\n    So dark there wasn't light\r\n  Somewheres about if I took care\r\n  To strike a match and find out where.\r\n\r\n\r\n_John Kendrick Bangs._\r\n\r\nFrom \"Songs of Cheer.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LIFE WITHOUT PASSION\r\n\r\n\r\nA person may feel deeply without shouting his emotion to the skies, or\r\nbe strong without seizing occasions to exhibit his strength. In truth we\r\ndistrust the power which makes too much a display of itself. Let it\r\nexert itself only to the point of securing the ends that are really\r\nnecessary. Restraint, self-control are in truth more mighty than might\r\nunshackled, just as a self-possessed opponent is more dangerous than a\r\nfrenzied one. Moreover, there is a moral side to the question. A good\r\nquality, if abused or allowed free sway, becomes a force for evil and\r\ndoes its owner more harm than if he had not possessed it in the first\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n\r\n  They that have power to hurt, and will do none,\r\n  That do not do the thing they most do show,\r\n  Who, moving others, are themselves as stone,\r\n  Unmoved, cold, and to temptation slow,--\r\n\r\n  They rightly",

"Unmoved, cold, and to temptation slow,--\r\n\r\n  They rightly do inherit heaven's graces,\r\n  And husband nature's riches from expense;\r\n  They are the lords and owners of their faces,\r\n  Others, but stewards of their excellence.\r\n\r\n  The summer's flower is to the summer sweet,\r\n  Though to itself it only live and die;\r\n  But if that flower with base infection meet,\r\n  The basest weed outbraves his dignity:\r\n\r\n  For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds;\r\n  Lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds.\r\n\r\n\r\n_William Shakespeare._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARACTER OF A HAPPY LIFE\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I'd rather be right than President,\" said Henry Clay. It is to men who\r\nare animated by this spirit that the greatest satisfaction in life\r\ncomes. For true blessedness does not lie far off and above us. It is\r\nclose at hand. Booker T. Washington once told a story of a ship that had\r\nexhausted its supply of fresh water and signaled its need to a passing\r\nvessel. The reply was, \"Send down your buckets where you are.\" Thinking\r\nthere was some misunderstanding, the captain repeated his signal, only\r\nto be answered as before. This time he did as he was bidden and secured\r\nan abundance of fresh water. His ship was opposite the mouth of a mighty\r\nriver which still kept its current unmingled with the waters of the\r\nocean.\r\n\r\n\r\n  How happy is he born and taught\r\n    That serveth not another's will;\r\n  Whose armor is his honest thought\r\n    And simple truth his utmost skill!\r\n\r\n  Whose passions not his masters are,\r\n    Whose soul is still prepared for death,\r\n  Not tied unto the world with care\r\n    Of public fame or private breath;\r\n\r\n  Who envies none that chance doth raise\r\n    Or vice; who never understood\r\n  How deepest wounds are given by praise\r\n    Nor rules of state, but rules of good;\r\n\r\n  Who hath his life from rumors freed,\r\n    Whose conscience is his strong retreat;\r\n  Whose state can neither flatterers feed,\r\n    Nor ruin make accusers great;\r\n\r\n  Who God doth late and early pray\r\n    More of his grace than gifts to lend;\r\n  And entertains the harmless day\r\n    With a well-chosen book or friend;\r\n\r\n --This man is freed from servile bands\r\n    Of hope to rise or fear to fall;\r\n  Lord of himself, though not of lands;\r\n    And having nothing, yet hath all.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sir Henry Wotton._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nESSENTIALS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe things here named are essential to a happy and successful life. They\r\nmay not be the only essentials.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Roll up your sleeves, lad, and begin;\r\n  Disarm misfortune with a grin;\r\n  Let discontent not wag your chin--\r\n  Let gratitude.\r\n\r\n    Don't try to find things all askew;\r\n  Don't be afraid of what is new;\r\n  Nor banish as unsound, untrue,\r\n  A platitude.\r\n\r\n    If folks don't act as you would choose\r\n  Remember life is varied; use\r\n  Your common sense; don't get the blues;\r\n  Show latitude.\r\n\r\n    Sing though in quavering sharps and flats,\r\n  Love though the folk you love are cats,\r\n  Work though you're worn and weary--that's\r\n  The attitude.\r\n\r\n\r\n_St. Clair Adams._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STONE REJECTED\r\n\r\n\r\nThe story here poetically retold of the great Florentine sculptor shows\r\nhow much a lofty spirit may make of unpromising material.\r\n\r\n\r\n  For years it had been trampled in the street\r\n  Of Florence by the drift of heedless feet--\r\n  The stone that star-touched Michael Angelo\r\n  Turned to that marble loveliness we know.\r\n\r\n  You mind the tale--how he was passing by\r\n  When the rude marble caught his Jovian eye,\r\n  That stone men had dishonored and had thrust\r\n  Out to the insult of the wayside dust.\r\n  He stooped to lift it from its mean estate,\r\n  And bore it on his shoulder to the gate,\r\n  Where all day long a hundred hammers rang.\r\n  And soon his chisel round the marble sang,\r\n  And suddenly the hidden angel shone:\r\n  It had been waiting prisoned in the stone.\r\n\r\n  Thus came the cherub with the laughing face\r\n  That long has lighted up an altar-place.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Edwin Markham._\r\n\r\nFrom \"The Gates of Paradise, and Other Poems.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGOOD DEEDS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe influence of good deeds

little candle throws his beams!\r\n  So shines a good deed in a naughty world.\r\n  Heaven doth with us as we with torches do;\r\n  Not light them for themselves; for if our virtues\r\n  Did not go forth of us, 'twere all alike\r\n  As if we had them not.\r\n\r\n\r\n_William Shakespeare._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYOU MAY COUNT THAT DAY\r\n\r\n\r\nA class of little settlement girls besought Mrs. George Herbert Palmer,\r\none insufferable summer morning, to tell them how to be happy. \"I'll\r\ngive you three rules,\" she said, \"and you must keep them every day for a\r\nweek. First, commit something good to memory each day. Three or four\r\nwords will do, just a pretty bit of poem, or a Bible verse. Do you\r\nunderstand?\" A girl jumped up. \"I know; you want us to learn something\r\nwe'd be glad to remember if we went blind.\" Mrs. Palmer was relieved;\r\nthese children understood. She gave the three rules--memorize something\r\ngood each day, see something beautiful each day, do something helpful\r\neach day. When the children reported at the end of the week, not a\r\nsingle day had any of them lost. But hard put to it to obey her? Indeed\r\nthey had been. One girl, kept for twenty-four hours within squalid\r\nhome-walls by a rain, had nevertheless seen two beautiful things--a\r\nsparrow taking a bath in the gutter, and a gleam of sunlight on a baby's\r\nhair.\r\n\r\n\r\n  If you sit down at set of sun\r\n     And count the acts that you have done,\r\n     And, counting, find\r\n  One self-denying deed, one word\r\n  That eased the heart of him who heard--\r\n     One glance most kind,\r\n  That fell like sunshine where it went--\r\n  Then you may count that day well spent.\r\n\r\n  But if, through all the livelong day,\r\n  You've cheered no heart, by yea or nay--\r\n     If, through it all\r\n  You've nothing done that you can trace\r\n  That brought the sunshine to one face--\r\n     No act most small\r\n  That helped some soul and nothing cost--\r\n  Then count that day as worse than lost.\r\n\r\n\r\n_George Eliot_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSADNESS AND MERRIMENT\r\n\r\n(ADAPTED FROM \"THE MERCHANT OF VENICE\")\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this passage Antonio states that he is overcome by a sadness he\r\ncannot account for. Salarino tells him that the mental attitude is\r\neverything; that mirth is as easy as gloom; that nature in her\r\nfreakishness makes some men laugh at trifles until their eyes become\r\nmere slits, yet leaves others dour and unsmiling before jests that would\r\nconvulse even the venerable Nestor. Gratiano maintains that Antonio is\r\ntoo absorbed in worldly affairs, and that he must not let his spirits\r\ngrow sluggish or irritable.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _ANT._     In sooth, I know not why I am so sad:\r\n  It wearies me; you say it wearies you;\r\n  But how I caught it, found it, or came by it,\r\n  What stuff 'tis made of, whereof it is born,\r\n  I am to learn.\r\n\r\n  _Salar_.     Then let's say you are sad\r\n  Because you are not merry: and 'twere as easy\r\n  For you to laugh and leap, and say you are merry,\r\n  Because you are not sad. Now, by two-headed Janus,\r\n  Nature hath framed strange fellows in her time:\r\n  Some that will evermore peep through their eyes\r\n  And laugh like parrots at a bag-piper,\r\n  And other of such vinegar aspect\r\n  That they'll not show their teeth in way of smile,\r\n  Though Nestor swear the jest be laughable.\r\n\r\n  _Gra_.    You look not well, Signior Antonio;\r\n  You have too much respect upon the world:\r\n  They lose it that do buy it with much care:\r\n  Believe me, you are marvelously changed.\r\n\r\n  _Ant_.    I hold the world but as the world, Gratiano\r\n  A stage where every man must play a part,\r\n  And mine a sad one.\r\n\r\n  _Gra_.    Let me play the fool:\r\n  With mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come,\r\n  And let my liver rather heat with wine\r\n  Than my heart cool with mortifying groans.\r\n  Why", "mimetype":

knock off half the debt. \"I won't\r\nlet you outdo me in generosity,\" said the man; \"I'll knock off the other\r\nhalf.\" Similarly, when we resolve to live down our causes of gloom, fate\r\ncomes to our aid and removes most of them altogether.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Let us smile along together,\r\n  Be the weather\r\n    What it may.\r\n  Through the waste and wealth of hours,\r\n  Plucking flowers\r\n    By the way.\r\n  Fragrance from the meadows blowing,\r\n  Naught of heat or hatred knowing,\r\n  Kindness seeking, kindness sowing,\r\n    Not to-morrow, but to-day.\r\n\r\n  Let us sing along, beguiling\r\n  Grief to smiling\r\n    In the song.\r\n  With the promises of heaven\r\n  Let us leaven\r\n    The day long,\r\n  Gilding all the duller seemings\r\n  With the roselight of our

Impossible! I knew his father.\" This attitude\r\ntowards distinction of any sort, whether in authorship or in the field\r\nof action, is characteristic of many of us. We think transcendent\r\nability is entirely above and apart from the things of ordinary life.\r\nYet genius itself has been defined as common sense in an uncommon\r\ndegree. The great men are human. Shakespeare remembered this when he\r\nsaid, \"I think the king is but a man as I am.\" We should take heart at\r\nthe thought that since the great are like us, we may develop ourselves\r\nuntil we are like them.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The great were once as you.\r\n  They whom men magnify to-day\r\n  Once groped and blundered on life's way,\r\n  Were fearful of themselves, and thought\r\n  By magic was men's greatness wrought.\r\n  They feared to try what they could do;\r\n  Yet Fame hath crowned with her success\r\n  The selfsame gifts that you possess.\r\n\r\n  The great were young as you,\r\n

Stanton._\r\n\r\nFrom \"The Atlanta Constitution.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN EARTH'S LAST PICTURE IS PAINTED\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is it that a human being wants? Most of us have something that we\r\nlike to do more than anything else. We are not free to do it as we wish.\r\nWe are handicapped by the need to earn a living, by physical weariness,\r\nby the carpings and scoffs of the envious, by the limited time we have\r\nat our disposal. But underneath all this is _the spirit of work_--the\r\ndesire to take up our task for its own sake alone, to give our whole\r\nselves to it, to carry it through, not in some partial way, but in\r\naccordance with the fulness of our dream. We want to be free from\r\ndistractions and interruptions; if we are driven at all, we want it to\r\nbe by our own inner promptings, not by obligation or necessity. Of\r\ncourse these favorable, these ideal conditions belong to heaven, not to\r\nearth. Kipling here explains what they will mean to the artist, the\r\npainter; but in doing so he expresses the longings of the true workman\r\nof whatsoever sort--he sums up the true spirit of work.\r\n\r\n\r\n  When Earth's last picture is painted and the tubes are twisted and dried,\r\n  When the oldest colors have faded, and the youngest critic has died,\r\n  We shall rest, and, faith, we shall need it--lie down for an aeon or two,\r\n  Till the Master of All Good Workmen shall set us to work anew.\r\n\r\n  And those that were good will be happy: they shall sit in a golden chair;\r\n  They shall splash at a ten-league canvas with brushes of comets' hair.\r\n  They shall find real saints to draw from--Magdalene, Peter, and Paul;\r\n  They shall work for an age at a sitting and never be tired at", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 332033, "end_char_idx": 335733, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}",

INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the\r\ntrademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone\r\nproviding copies of Project Gutenberg\u2122 electronic works in\r\naccordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the\r\nproduction, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg\u2122\r\nelectronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,\r\nincluding legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of\r\nthe following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this\r\nor any Project Gutenberg\u2122 work, (b) alteration, modification, or\r\nadditions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg\u2122 work, and (c) any\r\nDefect you cause.\r\n\r\nSection 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg\u2122\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\u2122\u2019s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\u2122 collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg\u2122 and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\u2019s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\r\nU.S. federal laws and your state\u2019s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\u2019s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\r\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\r\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation\u2019s website\r\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\r\n\r\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\r\n\r\nSection 5.
