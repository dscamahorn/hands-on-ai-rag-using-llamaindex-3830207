But\\r\\nbefore it has been done, it is called impossible. One reason why people\\r\\nfear to embark upon great enterprises is that they see all the\\r\\ndifficulties at once. They know they could succeed in the initial tasks,\\r\\nbut they shrink from what is to follow. Yet \"a thing begun is half\\r\\ndone.\" Moreover the surmounting of the first barrier gives strength and\\r\\ningenuity for the harder ones beyond. Mountains viewed from a distance\\r\\nseem to be unscalable. But they can be climbed, and the way to begin is\\r\\nto take the first upward step. From that moment the mountains are less\\r\\nhigh. As Hannibal led his army across the foothills, then among the\\r\\nupper ranges, and finally over the loftiest peaks and passes of the\\r\\nAlps, or as Peary pushed farther and farther into the solitudes that\\r\\nencompass the North Pole, so can you achieve any purpose whatsoever if\\r\\nyou heed not the doubters, meet each problem as it arises, and keep ever\\r\\nwith you the assurance _It Can Be Done_.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  Somebody said that it couldn\\'t be done,\\r\\n    But he with a chuckle replied\\r\\n  That \"maybe it couldn\\'t,\" but he would be one\\r\\n    Who wouldn\\'t say so till he\\'d tried.\\r\\n  So he buckled right in with the trace of a grin\\r\\n    On his face. If he worried he hid it.\\r\\n  He started to sing as he tackled the thing\\r\\n    That couldn\\'t be done, and he did it.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Somebody scoffed: \"Oh, you\\'ll never do that;\\r\\n    At least no one ever has done it\";\\r\\n  But he took off his coat and he took off his hat,\\r\\n    And the first thing we knew he\\'d begun it.\\r\\n  With a lift of his chin and a bit of a grin,\\r\\n    Without any doubting or quiddit,\\r\\n  He started to sing as he tackled the thing\\r\\n    That couldn\\'t be done, and he did it.\\r\\n\\r\\n  There are thousands to tell you it cannot be done,\\r\\n    There are thousands to prophesy failure;\\r\\n  There are thousands to point out to you one by one,\\r\\n    The dangers that wait to assail you.\\r\\n  But just buckle in with a bit of a grin,\\r\\n    Just take off your coat and go to it;\\r\\n  Just start to sing as you tackle the thing\\r\\n    That \"cannot be done,\" and you\\'ll do it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n_Edgar A.

Second is the\\r\\nfreedom brought by the recollection of good fellowship, when tried and\\r\\ntrue comrades took their wine straight--\"with no allaying Thames.\" Third\\r\\nis the freedom brought by remembrance of the king for whom he was\\r\\nsuffering.
