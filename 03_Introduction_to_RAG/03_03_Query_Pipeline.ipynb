      "Shakespeare, the OG wordsmith, drops some knowledge about keepin' it real and stayin' true to yourself. It's like, \"Be a good friend, but don't go overboard and be a people-pleaser. Know your worth and don't be borrowin' or lendin' all willy-nilly.\" \n",

And then there\\'s this poem by S.E. Kiser, \"The Fighter,\" which is all about how life is a constant struggle and we gotta stay strong and keep fighting if we wanna come out on top. Margaret Widdemer hits us with some real talk in \"To Youth After Pain,\" reminding us that pain is inevitable, but it\\'s also what helps us relate to others and build sympathy.\\n\\nThen Grantland Rice comes through with \"Can\\'t,\" a poem that\\'s like, \"Yo, don\\'t ever say you can\\'t because that\\'s when you fail.\" It\\'s all about having the right mindset and not letting fear hold you back. And Etta Wheeler Wilcox is like, \"Yeah, we all make mistakes, but that\\'s how we learn and grow, so keep moving forward.\"\\n\\nWhistler and Shakespeare drop some knowledge about not letting gloom and negativity bring you down. It\\'s all about finding joy and being true to yourself. And Edgar A.
