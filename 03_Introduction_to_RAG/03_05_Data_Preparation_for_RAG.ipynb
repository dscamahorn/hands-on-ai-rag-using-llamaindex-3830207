    "Your RAG system is only as good as the data you retrieve. \n",
    "\n",
    "That's why data preparation and cleaning are important steps to ensure high-quality results. **This course purposefully uses simple PDF files, specifically books, to demonstrate the process.** There's so much to data preparation for RAG that I could write another two-hour course just on that topic. However, it's important to acknowledge that real-world PDFs and other documents can be much more complex, requiring additional processing and cleaning techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Considerations for data prep\n",
    "\n",
    "- üìú **Document Content**: Utilize text from documents for keyword searches or to find similar content in RAG applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "- üìë **Document Elements**: Break down documents into fundamental parts to assist in RAG tasks like filtering and segmenting, like:\n",
    "  - Titles\n",
    "  - Narrative text\n",
    "  - List items\n",
    "  - Tables\n",
    "  - Images\n",
    "\n",
    "- üè∑ **Element Metadata**: Provide additional details for each document element to support hybrid search and track information origin, such as:\n",
    "  - Filename\n",
    "  - Filetype\n",
    "  - Page number\n",
    "  - Section\n",
    "\n",
    "- üîÑ **Summary**: Explains document preprocessing for retrieval systems, focusing on transforming documents into searchable elements and metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
