    "- üìö **Retrieval**: Find and return the most relevant documents from the `Index` using strategies like \"top-k\" semantic retrieval.\n",

    "- üîß **Postprocessing**: Optionally rerank, transform, or filter retrieved Nodes, often based on specific metadata like keywords.\n",

In this passage the fable is used as an answer to the\\r\\nplebeians of Rome who have complained that the patricians are merely an\\r\\nencumbrance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  There was a time when all the body\\'s members\\r\\n  Rebelled against the belly; thus accused it:\\r\\n  That only like a gulf it did remain\\r\\n  I\\' the midst o\\' the body, idle and unactive,\\r\\n  Still cupboarding the viand, never bearing\\r\\n  Like labor with the rest, where the other instruments\\r\\n  Did see and hear, devise, instruct, walk, feel,\\r\\n  And, mutually participant, did minister\\r\\n  Unto the appetite and affection common\\r\\n  Of the whole body. Note me this, good friend;\\r\\n  Your most grave belly was deliberate,\\r\\n  Not rash like his accusers, and thus answered:\\r\\n  \"True is it, my incorporate friends,\" quoth he,\\r\\n  \"That I receive the general food at first,\\r\\n  Which you do live upon; and fit it is;\\r\\n  Because I am the store-house and the shop\\r\\n  Of the whole body: but, if you do remember,\\r\\n  I send it through the rivers of your blood,\\r\\n  Even to the court, the heart, to the seat o\\' the brain:\\r\\n  And, through the cranks and offices of man,\\r\\n  The strongest nerves and small inferior veins\\r\\n  From me receive that natural competency\\r\\n  Whereby they live. Though all at once cannot\\r\\n  See what I do deliver out to each,\\r\\n  Yet I can make my audit up, that all\\r\\n  From me do back receive the flour of all,\\r\\n  And leave me but the bran.\" What say you to \\'t?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n_William Shakespeare._\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE CELESTIAL SURGEON\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWe may acquire the resolution to be happy by resting on a bed of roses.\\r\\nIf that fails us, we should try a bed of nettles.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  If I have faltered more or less\\r\\n  In my great task of happiness;\\r\\n  If I have moved among my race\\r\\n  And shown no glorious morning face;\\r\\n  If beams from happy human eyes\\r\\n  Have moved me not; if morning skies,\\r\\n  Books, and my food, and summer rain\\r\\n  Knocked on my sullen heart in vain:--\\r\\n  Lord, thy most pointed pleasure take\\r\\n  And stab my spirit broad awake;\\r\\n  Or, Lord, if too obdurate I,\\r\\n  Choose thou, before that spirit die,\\r\\n  A piercing pain, a killing sin,\\r\\n  And to my dead heart run them in!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n_Robert Louis Stevenson._\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMAN, BIRD, AND GOD\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRobert Bruce, despairing of his country\\'s cause, was aroused to new hope\\r\\nand purpose by the sight of a spider casting its lines until at last it\\r\\nhad one that held. In the following passage the poet, uncertain as to\\r\\nhis own future, yet trusts the providence which guides the birds in\\r\\ntheir long and uncharted migrations.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  I go to prove my soul!\\r\\n  I see my way as birds their trackless way.\\r\\n  I shall arrive! what time, what circuit first,\\r\\n  I ask not: but unless God send his hail\\r\\n  Or blinding fireballs, sleet or stifling snow,\\r\\n  In some time, his good time, I shall arrive:\\r\\n  He guides me and the bird. In his good time!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n_Robert Browning._\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHIS ALLY\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe thought of this poem is that a man\\'s best helper may be that which\\r\\ngives him no direct aid at all--a sense of humor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  He fought for his soul, and the stubborn fighting\\r\\n    Tried hard his strength.\\r\\n  \"One needs seven souls for this long requiting,\"\\r\\n    He said at length.\\r\\n\\r\\n  \"Six times have I come where my first hope jeered me\\r\\n    And laughed me to scorn;\\r\\n  But now I fear as I never feared me\\r\\n    To fall forsworn.\\r\\n\\r\\n  \"God! when they fight upright and at me\\r\\n    I give them back\\r\\n  Even such blows as theirs that combat me;\\r\\n    But now, alack!\\r\\n\\r\\n  \"They fight with the wiles of fiends escaping\\r\\n    And underhand.\\r\\n  Six times, O God, and my wounds are gaping!\\r\\n    I--reel to stand.\\r\\n\\r\\n  \"Six battles\\' span!
